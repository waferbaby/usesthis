### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm Vladimir Mitrović, a software engineer/computational designer/artist from Belgrade, Serbia. I'm creating [abstract](http://brutalism.rs/project/unwelcome-gaze/ "Vladimir's social graph project.") [data visualizations](http://brutalism.rs/project/itinerant/ "Vladimir's experimental weather forecast project.") and aesthetic engines. You can read more about my projects and what I'm currently up to on [my website](http://brutalism.rs/ "Vladimir's website."). I also [tweet](https://twitter.com/pttrn "Vladimir's Twitter account.") from time to time.

### What hardware do you use?

My home studio has quite a bit of hardware in it. I've recently shelled out a bag of cash on a 2019 [iMac Pro][imac-pro], and I have zero regrets – it's a beast. My eyes are also thankful, as I was looking at low-PPI monitors for decades.

I'm a mechanical keyboard afficionado, although I try not to geek out as much as I'd want to. My main keyboard is a [tokyo60][], and I have a [HHKB Type-S][happy-hacking-keyboard-professional-type-s] as backup when I want to change things up a bit. Once you get accustomed to the HHKB keyboard layout (which both of them have), there's no going back. I also have an old Filco [Ninja TKL][ninja-majestouch-2] and a Vortex [Race 3][race-3] but I'm not using them all that much these days.

When I'm on the go, I'm still relying on my trusty 2013 [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro], which was pretty beefed up back in 2013 so it can still hold its ground. Since most of my work is GPU-heavy, I can't go for the lightweight options like the [MacBook Air][macbook-air] or Huawei [Matebook X Pro][matebook-x-pro], although I would certainly love to.

I also have a 50" Samsung 4K TV mounted in portrait mode behind a [standing desk][jaswig], which I'm using as my "art canvas" by hooking it up to the MacBook. The poor NVIDIA [GeForce GT 750M][geforce-gt-750m] in that laptop is struggling to keep up with 4K, but it's chugging along. I'll probably get a small desktop ([Mac Mini][mac-mini] or something similar from the PC world) to hook it up to that display permanently at some point.

As for audio, I have a pair of Monitor Audio [Bronze 2][bronze-2] speakers hooked up to a Yamaha [A-S301][] stereo amp, and of course a subwoofer (Mission [MS-Cube][]) to keep things well oiled. All in black, naturally. I have way too many headphones – Grado [SR325e][], Fostex [TR-90][], AIAIAI [TMA-1][], HiFiMAN [HE-4XX][], and my current go-to, the trusty Beyerdynamic [DT 770 Pro][dt-770-pro]. I've come to realize that Beyerdynamic's sound signature suits me the most – I also have a pair of Beyerdynamic [DX 120 iE][dx-120-ie] earphones for when I'm on the go, which are probably still the best value for money I got on anything, ever.

### And what software?

I'm a UNIX-head, coming from [Slackware][] and [Arch Linux][arch-linux] back in my high school/uni days. Nowadays I'm mostly using [OS X][macos] since it's a well-rounded UNIX that's comfortable to use day-to-day. That said, I wish I had more time to spend with Linux again, but I'm afraid that heavy computer graphics work and Linux's flaky GPU drivers won't be up to the task. I haven't checked how that scene has developed over the years, so might be wrong. (I hope I am!)

My main environment for visual work is [Unity][] with JetBrains [Rider][] as the IDE. For [Clojure][] work I'm using [IntelliJ IDEA][intellij-idea] with the excellent [Cursive][] plugin. I'm keeping one eye on [Rust][] and hoping that in the coming years a modern open-source creative coding framework (a-la [openFrameworks][]) will be born. It's time for [C++][c-plusplus] to die a slow death.

I'm not big on text editors as I generally don't care about them (I prefer IDEs). For simple text editing I was using [Atom][] and [VS Code][visual-studio-code] up until recently when [Electron][] started rendering fonts terribly on OS X. I'm trying to stay away from Electron-based apps generally (Atom, VS Code, [Slack][], etc) since Electron is [Flash][] for the desktop. A terrible trend. I switched to [Sublime Text 3][sublime-text] since it's fast and native. I've used Emacs/Vim enough in my Linux days to know that I don't care about any of that geekery.

I use [Git][] for all of my projects, mostly from the command line (my shell is [zsh][] with the wonderful [oh-my-zsh][] framework). When I need to get a better high-level overview of the repo, I use [Fork][] which I found is the most streamlined of all Git UIs and doesn't hold your hand too much.

### What would be your dream setup?

I would actually keep my current hardware/software setup as I don't need any more gadgets, but I do need more time! So my dream setup would be to have all the time in the world to work on art and open-source projects and not worry about money at all. (You did say "dream setup", so there you go.)

That said, in the coming months I would like to find a comfortable studio space where I can do undisturbed work and also have the option to invite friends or clients to come over for a show-and-tell and a drink or two. :)
