### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is Alex Norris. I'm a queer cartoonist and performer based in London UK, best known for my webcomic named "[Webcomic Name](https://webcomicname.com/ "Alex's web comic.")".

### What hardware do you use?

I've always been an advocate that expensive hardware shouldn't be a barrier for artists, because so many working class/low income people feel shut out of the online art world because they don't have the 'right' equipment. I still think you can make a great webcomic by simply taking photos of sketchbook drawings with your phone. I started out drawing comics by hand with cheap pens (Staedler [Pigment Liner][pigment-liner-308] or Uni [Pin Fine Line][pin-fine-line] are still my go-to). I would then scan them in using my local library scanner and colour them using a free program like [GIMP][].

When I moved to digital drawing I used a Wacom [Intuos][] tablet with my cheap Acer laptop. "Webcomic Name" is made to be fully digital and drawing on the go is important for me, so I now use an [iPad Pro][ipad-pro] for drawing but I still plan every comic in a small portable sketchbook and make all of my notes in there.

### And what software?

I used to use GIMP because it was free, then moved to a pirated version of [Photoshop][]. I now pay for my software (of course!) and I use [Clip Studio Paint][clip-studio-paint-ios] which I think is the best and simplest and most affordable drawing software for comics in my style.

### What would be your dream setup?

I think I already have my dream set-up! I am not fussy and the main thing I love is writing and drawing comics without getting bogged down in technical stuff. However, I would love to have a way of drawing while cycling!
