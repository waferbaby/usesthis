### Who are you, and what do you do?

[Steiner](http://steiner.bigcartel.com/ "Steiner's website.") - I'm an artist who currently lives in Los Angeles, and I previously spent years living in New York City and San Francisco. I paint large street murals, canvases, and illustration. I mostly paint bright, slightly mutated animals and creatures with lots of patterns and weird shit.

### What hardware do you use?

For murals I use spray paint, mostly Montana, Mtn 94, Fresh Paint and lots of house paint to buff out backgrounds and whatnot.

For canvases I use mostly acrylic Liquitex, Golden and some other random brands. I'll also use 1-shot enamel for certain projects. I like painting on wood the most, but lately have been using canvas as well.

For illustrations I always start off with a mechanical pencil, either .5 or .7 lead. To ink it up I use vellum paper and sharpies of all sizes, [microns][pigma-micron] and a lot of different Japanese brush pens. If I use color markers, it tends to be Prismacolors or COPICs.

### And what software?

[Adobe Illustrator][illustrator] and [Photoshop][] on my [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro]. Photoshop to clean up drawings and make screen printing files, etc.

### What would be your dream setup?

I really want to make my own custom grayscale 4 color BIC pen with an all black and gray body. It's my dream.

Other than that, a ton of good spray paint in every color, every color Prismacolor marker, a giant new Mac monitor and computer, a Sharpie sponsorship, and a bad ass air conditioner for my studio, and for my studio to be a mega yacht. 

Real simple attainable things.
