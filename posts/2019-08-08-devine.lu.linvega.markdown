### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is Devine, and I create [esoteric software](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/software "Devine's software.") while travelling aboard a [sailboat](https://100r.co/pages/pino.html "Devine and Rekka's house/boat page.") with my partner [Rekka](https://usesthis.com/interviews/rekka.bell/ "Rekka's Uses This interview.") - we are presently moored in a quiet inlet, deep within the Japanese coast where sleep the remains of ancient towns, overgrown with lichen. 

I am tempted to say that I write [music](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/Audio "Devine's music."), but saying that [I write programs to write music][orca] would be more accurate. The same could be said about design, but I do like to pick up a pen to [draw once in a while](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/Artwork "Devine's artwork."). Rekka and I are making [games](https://100r.co/pages/games.html "Devine and Rekka's games."), [tools](https://100r.co/pages/tools.html "Devine and Rekka's software tools.") and [books](https://100r.co/pages/books.html "Devine and Rekka's books.") together. We also [document our life aboard the boat](http://youtube.com/hundredrabbits "Devine and Rekka's YouTube channel.") as we experiment with low-tech hardware and software solutions.

### What hardware do you use?

I use a [2014 MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] with an even older Wacom Tablet. With this one, I do front-end work, be it layouts, websites, movies or games. I use it to browse the web, post on [Mastodon](https://merveilles.town/@neauoire/ "Devine's Mastodon account."), chat on IRC, play [Quake][] and so on. I run the [Elementary][elementary-os] GNU/Linux distribution, and [Macintosh System 7][system-7] via [Mini vMac][mini-vmac].

I also frequently use a [singleboard computer][raspberry-pi-3b-plus] hooked to a small 7" screen, and a [mechanical keyboard](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/Keyboard "Devine's mechanical keyboard page."). Its purpose is to do experimental software development, read and write long-form emails and blogs, with nothing besides music to pull me away from the task at hand. It draws very little power, and discourages multi-tasking. On it, I run the [9front][] fork of [Plan 9][plan-9].

### And what software?

The list of software I use is in constant flux, but at the moment of writing this, here's some notable software that I use daily. I also maintain an active list [here](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/computer "Devine's current gear list.").

- [Fish Shell][fish].
- [Micro][] text editor.
- [Toot Mastodon client][toot].
- [cmus][] audio player.
- [nnn][] file manager.
- [Spreadsheet Calculator][sc-im].
- [Krita][] digital painting.
- [Blender][] 3D editor.
- [surf][] browser.
- [Cozy][] audiobook player.

### What would be your dream setup?

In the way of hardware, I dream of an affordable [RISC-V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V "The Wikipedia entry for RISC-V.") single-board computer. I also dream of a modular OS that truly embodies the ideas of Linux, like Plan9, but based on a dialect of [LISP][] with deep source control capabilities like [NixOS][]. This magical computer would be _designed to work offline_, would not try to call home, use DRMs, it would be inspectable, modifiable and environmentally counscious.

Also, if I could have one last wish, it would have a 1/4" headphone jack, and a [orthogonal keyboard](https://olkb.com/planck).
