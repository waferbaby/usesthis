### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm Kat, and by day I'm an IT project manager and business analyst. However, by night I create videos about anime figurines and other Japanese pop-culture items on YouTube as [Kitto Katsu](https://www.youtube.com/c/kittokatsutsu "Kat's YouTube account.")! I also run [a website](http://www.kittokatsu.net/ "Kat's website.") of the same name which has news, reviews and other announcements from the Japanese pop-culture scene, and administrate a website on collectibles called [My Figure Collection](https://myfigurecollection.net/profile/Katto "Kat's profile on My Figure Collection.").

### What hardware do you use?

For my photography and videos I use a [Canon EOS 650D][eos-650d]/Rebel T4i with a [Sigma 17-70mm f/2.8-4 DC Macro OS lens][17-70mm-f2.8-4-dc-macro-os-hsm], a pair of umbrella lights and a [Vanguard Espod CX 233AGH tripod][espod-cx-233agh]. On occassion I'll use a muslin backdrop if I want a more neutral background for the footage (like in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5E2tA_WllbM "Kat's YouTube review of a Link figurine.") and in most cases I'll use a plain old wooden coffee table and a [G Tool Mr. Turn Table][mr-turn-table]. I've also made a custom turntable for items that are too heavy for the rotating display. On occassion I'll use the [F&V R-300 LED ring light][r-300], and a Mini Portable Photo Studio.

For editing I'll use my desktop computer with dual Nvidia cards running in SLI, and for recording audio I use a [Blue Yeti mic][yeti] with [The Pop filter][the-pop] or the [Zoom H4n Handy Recorder][h4n].

If I'm away from my equipment and need to take photos quickly for [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kittokatsutsu "Kat's Twitter account.") updates and whatnot, like for major events, I'll use my handy-dandy [iPhone 6][iphone-6].

### And what software?

Software-wise, for editing I swear by [Sony Vegas Pro][vegas-pro] for video and [Audacity][] for audio recording and editing. For editing photography I'll use [Lightroom][] or quick edits will be done using [GIMP][].

Other than that, because most of what I do is social media based, naturally I use [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/kittokatsutsu "Kat's Facebook page."), Twitter and [Wix][] for my website.

### What would be your dream setup?

My dream setup would definitely be having a dedicated studio for recording and editing videos without being bothered or bothering anyone around. Which I am currently in the process of setting up, thankfully!

But as for products themselves, I'd be adding soundproofing foam, a bigger light tent, a better podcasting station to have guests visit and record in person, and on the other side of things, have a big enough travel bag to carry all the important equipment for recording interviews externally.

And if we're going total dream setup, a [Canon 5D Mk IV][eos-5d-mark-iv] and [EF 100mm f/2.8L Macro IS USM lens][ef-100mm-f2.8l-is-usm], and more lights in general.

If I could go as far as having anything, I suppose I'd happily ask for a full-time video editor as well! Haha.
