### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm Eric Socolofsky. Right now, I visualize data for a living (on [Uber's Visualization team](http://vis.gl/ "Uber's data visualisation team."); before that, [Stamen](https://stamen.com/ "A digital agency in SF."), and before that, the [Exploratorium](https://www.exploratorium.edu/ "A science museum in SF.")). I've also designed science exhibits (at the Exploratorium), made video games (at [Gamelab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamelab "An indie gaming studio.") and [as an indie dev][eleminer]), digital/physical installation art (at [Eyebeam](https://www.eyebeam.org/ "An art and tech space in Brooklyn.")), and some other bits and bobs. The best bobs and some of the good bits are up on [transmote.com](http://transmote.com/ "Eric's website.").

### What hardware do you use?

Most of the stuff I do now is web-based, which means my [MacBook][] and [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] are my main tools. I'm also a long-time fan of Rhodia 1/5" graph pads and uni-ball [Vision Elite][vision-elite] pens.

I used to use a lot of [Arduinos][arduino] and a few [Raspberry Pis][raspberry-pi]. Point Grey cameras and 3M capacitive multitouch screens too. And don't forget about all those Happ buttons! So many Happ buttons. And you can't go wrong with Unistrut and 80/20.

### And what software?

Writing mostly for the Web these days, the answer to the Software? question is obvious: [JavaScript][].

More specifically, almost everything I build these days is a [React][] app.

My toolchain is usually [npm][], [Yarn][], [Babel][babel.2].

My main visualization tools include [D3][d3.js], [Vega][vega.2], and the Vis.gl suite, specifically [deck.gl][] and [kepler.gl][]. I should make more Observables. For my installation and artworks, I still <3 [Processing][], tinker with [openFrameworks][], and have used [PixiJS][] to good effect.  

### What would be your dream setup?

My dream setup would be to have someone else take care of all of the infrastructure bullshit I have to deal with on a regular basis (toolchain, local env setup / maintenance, continuous integration, deploy) so I can just design and write code. It would also be nice to be able to play all my old mp3s from [Spotify][], so I'm not stuck listening to the same new music over and over again.
