### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm Arda Koyuncu, a character artist and a photographer currently working at Goodbye Kansas Studios, Los Angeles. I'm the Head of Character Art, making a bunch of characters for various projects, figuring out how to utilize the newest technologies to make better digital characters and create new workflows. I find nature really inspiring, which definitely helps understand and improve making characters but also pushes me to be outdoors, capturing moments I want to come back to.

Spending a good amount of time outdoors triggered certain thoughts and ideas quite some time ago; so on the photography front, a few friends and I are currently working on making a new type of content for Virtual Reality we call [Holophotography](http://www.brinkvr.com/ "Arda's project for photo-realistic captures of real-world places.").

You can find my artwork on [ardakoyuncu.com](https://ardakoyuncu.com/ "Arda's website.") and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/arda.koyuncu/ "Arda's Instagram account.").

### What hardware do you use?

I'm working with two separate workstations at the moment. One of them is an Intel [i7-6800K][core-i7-6800k], 64GB RAM, [GeForce GTX 1080][geforce-gtx-1080] with 2x27" LG 4K displays. The other is an Intel [i7-8700K][core-i7-8700k], 64GB RAM, [GeForce RTX 2080][geforce-rtx-2080] TI with 2x27" HP displays.

My go-to mouse is Logitech [MX Master][mx-master]. When I'm sculpting and painting I use the [Intuos 4 Pro][intuos-pro] and Razer [Nostromo][nostromo] as my input devices. I also work on the 15" Razer [Blade][], (the non RTX version, unfortunately - that one came out 3 weeks after I purchased mine) when I'm away from home.

For my photography, timelapses and photogrammetry I use a Canon [6D][eos-6d]. I own a variety of lenses and hardware that go with the camera - the [EF 50mm f/1.2L USM][ef-50mm-f1.2l-usm], [EF 24mm f/1.4L II USM][ef-24mm-f1.4l-ii-usm], and [EF 85mm f/1.8 USM][ef-85mm-f1.8-usm] are my go-to lenses. I have a couple of fisheye lenses and polarizers, and my tripod is an Oben [CT-2461][] that works with the Manfrotto mini ball head.

When I'm developing Holophotography for VR, I'm on the new Oculus [Quest][] and an Oculus [Rift S][rift-s]. I am also waiting for some new DJI toys - curious to see what will come after Mavic. Once they release the next generation of drones I'm definitely getting one.

### And what software?

I use a lot of different software for a lot of different things. If I'm making digital character stuff I am generally busy in [3ds Max][3ds-max], [Maya][], [ZBrush][] or [Marvelous Designer][marvelous-designer]. If I'm painting I prefer [Mari][], [Substance Painter][substance-painter] and [Photoshop][] - I haven't had the time to get into [Substance Designer][substance-designer] yet, but it's definitely on the list. There are also a lot of tools I use here and there to make various things; [xNormal][], [CrazyBump][], [Ornatrix][], [XGen][] to name a few.

When it comes to look development, depending on the project and the need, I end up using [V-Ray][], [Arnold][], [KeyShot][], [Unity][] and/or [Unreal Engine][unreal-engine]. More and more I am spending time in real-time engines instead of offline renderers, especially Unreal Engine and Unity. I am one of those people that think real-time is the future, but I definitely enjoy seeing little boxes resolve my offline render while sipping my coffee. 

My go-to photogrammetry tool is [Reality Capture][reality-capture]. And then there's [Lightroom][], [After Effects][after-effects] and [LRTimelapse][] for my photography.

Most of the time I find myself jumping between all of these tools constantly - I start from one tool and end in another one. There are many times I discover obscure tools freely available on the web to experiment with tiny tasks here and there. If they end up being useful, they become another tool I'd like to have in my arsenal. I keep lists of things I'm failing to do with the tools I know how to use, and once I find something that might help me check another issue off the list it becomes another permanent tool. Lately I've been looking into tools that can do precise mesh matching with minimal input, regardless of scale and orientation.
