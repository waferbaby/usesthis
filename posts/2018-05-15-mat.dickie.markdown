#### Who are you, and what do you do?

Under the abbreviated signature of "[MDickie](http://www.mdickie.com/ "Mat's website.")", I've been making games on my own terms since 2000. Originally for the PC, but in 2012 I reinvented myself as a mobile developer - which proved to be a better fit for my retro brand of gaming. My low-poly, low-resolution visuals are easy to criticize, but the performance I get out of a smaller download has allowed me to push a lot of boundaries. I've managed to release 10 different mobile apps in a row that have surpassed a million downloads, and maintained a 4-star review average under that scrutiny. The most popular is [Wrestling Revolution 3D][wrestling-revolution-3d-android], which recently became the first game of its kind to reach the milestone of 50 million downloads.

#### What hardware do you use?

I've always preferred to use laptops as I travel quite often and need to take my work with me. When I talk about being a "mobile developer", it refers to the games being made on the move as well as played on the move! My current laptop is a high-end [Microsoft Surface Book][surface-book] because I liked the idea of it being touch-screen (although that has yet to manifest itself in any meaningful way). As a developer of touch-screen apps, I'm a firm believer in that technology - so much so that my car is even touch-screen since I got a [Tesla][model-x]!

I also grudgingly keep a [MacBook Air][macbook-air] for uploading iOS apps, but I wouldn't choose to use it for anything else as I find Apple products to be a "closed system". Of course, I also keep a wide range of mobiles and tablets to test my apps on. My preferred one for daily use would be something in the Samsung Galaxy S range. I developed my first app on a [Samsung Galaxy S II][galaxy-s-ii], so my career has grown alongside that range.

#### And what software?

My mobile apps are developed in [Flash][], which is now known as "Animate CC". As much as I like it personally, it seems to be falling behind the rest of the industry and is not widely supported anymore - so I may need to jump to a more stable platform like [Unity][] eventually. I will do so grudgingly, however, as I've been getting good results out of Flash in 2D - and even in 3D with extensions like Flare 3D. I use [3ds Max][3ds-max] for my modelling, whereas any 2D art tends to come together in [Painter][] or [Paint.NET][]. For my sound engineering, I use [WavePad Sound Editor][wavepad]. I even used to make my own music in programs like [Magix Music Maker][music-maker], but it has been a while since I did that! I prefer to buy in music from professionals now. Not only is the quality better, but I get just as much pleasure from "discovering" new music as I did from making my own.

The software I use isn't necessarily the best there is. They're mainly old programs that I got into the habit of using and couldn't leave behind. My brand of game development is old-fashioned in every way, but I'm a pragmatist who sticks to what works.

#### What would be your dream setup?

I'm fortunate enough to be able to turn my dreams into reality, so I have my own studio in my own house and whatever technology I feel would be useful. I'm something of a minimalist with it, though, so my office is very streamlined and tidy to keep my mind clear. My garage is where all the old laptops go to die! I try to keep them all just in case there's the occasional file that I wish I still had access to. I only have problems when I leave my bubble. I just wish countries like China had a truly free internet, as it's tiresome to navigate around everything being blocked or censored. It's one of the reasons I don't live there anymore.
