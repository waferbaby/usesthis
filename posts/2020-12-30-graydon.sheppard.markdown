### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Graydon Sheppard](http://graydonsheppard.com/ "Graydon's website."). I'm a [writer](https://twitter.com/graydonsheppard "Graydon's Twitter account."), [director](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSKHbAFBwvI "Graydon's YouTube video of Chloë Sevigny."), and sometimes [performer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-yLGIH7W9Y "The first episode of Shit Girls Say."). Most of my work has been shorter form - [short films](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9eKrjdPjKo "Graydon's short film 'Muya'."), [music videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRjV904QxBE "The music video for 'Who Do We Care For?', by Sebastien Grainger."), [comedy sketches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWSNnJnkAgg "The introduction video for Influenced."), and [web series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErG963U3hxQ "The first episode of Coming In."). I used to make [commercials](https://vimeo.com/363947086/185fe1f885 "An ad for Claritin.") but I left that industry to focus on making longer format work. I constantly have side-projects on the go, like "[The Criterinot Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/the-criterinot-podcast/id1477383526 "Graydon's movie podcast.")" where I talk to other people in the industry about movies we love that _aren't_ in The Criterion Collection.

I am Canadian, and I recently moved to Montreal where I make a fool of myself daily while trying to speak French through masks and plexiglass.

### What hardware do you use?

I use a 2017 15" [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro]. I just found my "lost" Wacom tablet which I'm really happy about. It makes editing and visual stuff go so much more smoothly. For podcasting I use a [Scarlett 2i2 mixer][scarlett-2i2] with some $20 mics I got online. They are chunky and heavy but nobody has to see them so that's fine. They make me feel like the host of a 70s gameshow. And I have a [Fuji X-T1 camera][x-t1] that I love and use to film sketches and scout locations and occasionally take actual photographs to print. I got my bachelor's degree in photography right when everything was switching to digital, so it was basically a useless education, but because of it I also have an old [Mamiya RZ67 medium format film camera][rz67] that I just pulled out of storage. Doubt I'll ever use it again, but I have it!

### And what software?

Software-wise I use [Premiere][], [Photoshop][], [InDesign][], [Dreamweaver][], [After Effects][after-effects], [Final Draft][final-draft], and I used to use [Audacity][] for the podcast until the OS updated and made it obsolete. Now I use [Voice Memos][voice-memos-ios] for that. I use [Mail][] for the obvious reasons but also to write down notes on calls cause it's easier than opening [Word][]. I use [Stickies][] to track hours and write down quick ideas. Actually I'll use pretty much anything to write down an idea. Sometimes I create a folder and name it with an idea or a thought. It's really annoying for future me to deal with the messes I make, but that's his problem. I use [Dropbox][] like a life preserver - any project I'm working on has an alias on the desktop linked to a folder in Dropbox. But my favourite software is the game [Factorio][]. It can be a problem.

### What would be your dream setup?

Dream setup would be whatever is going to keep my spine from turning into a C-shape. I've got a really bad habit of sitting in things that look great but are giving me peach pit-sized knots in my neck. Is there such a thing as an office massage chair? Also, something with infinite, indestructible storage, and someone to organize it for me. I'm pretty good about backing up, but I'm terribly disorganized, so finding things can be an issue. A proper second display I guess would be nice. Headphone implants that are universal so that I don't have to scramble for the right pair to fit into the right device, or charge, or lose. Oh, a Mac without a touchbar. I hate that thing so much.
