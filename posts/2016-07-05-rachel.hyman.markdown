### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Rachel Hyman](http://rachelhyman.info/ "Rachel's website."). I am a software engineer, writer, and publisher. By day, I'm an [iOS][] Engineer at [Belly](https://www.bellycard.com/ "A rewards program."). On nights and weekends, I work on the songwriting app [Hum][hum-ios] and make maps for [Maps For Good](http://www.mapsforgood.org/ "A map designing firm."). I also recently ran a side business making Twitter bots called [Hotline Bot Club](http://hotlinebot.club/ "Rachel's bots.").

On the literary side, I [write](http://rachelhyman.info/publications/ "Rachel's writing.") mostly poetry. My poetry chapbook [Dear S](http://biglucks.bigcartel.com/product/dear-s-rachel-hyman "Rachel's poetry chapbook.") came out in 2015 on Big Lucks press. I also co-edit a literary journal called [Banango Street](http://banangostreet.com/ "A poetry journal.") and an echapbook publishing offshoot called [Banango Editions](http://banangoeditions.tumblr.com/ "Banango's echapbook Tumblr site."). I started a project called [Anthology of Chicago](http://www.anthologyofchicago.com/ "Rachel's Chicago story project.") that publishes neighborhood-focused poetry, fiction, and nonfiction. I co-curate a reading series called [Welcome to the Neighborhood](http://1001chicago.com/fortune-and-glory/welcome-to-the-neighborhood/ "A reading series about Chicago, co-organised by Rachel.") that brings together storytellers, poets, and essayists to perform pieces about Chicago's neighborhoods.

### What hardware do you use?

At work, I have a 15 inch [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] and [27 inch Thunderbolt monitor][thunderbolt-display]. Bose noise-canceling headphones are a must in my open office. My personal computer is a 13 inch [MacBook Air][macbook-air]. The Hotline Bot Club bots have been running on a [System76 Meerkat][meerkat] Linux server.

Lit-wise, I letterpressed the covers for the [Anthology of Chicago chapbook](http://anthologyofchicago.bigcartel.com/product/anthology-of-chicago-chapbook "The Anthology of Chicago chapbook.") on a [Vandercook 325G][325g] printing press at [Signal Return](http://www.signalreturnpress.org/ "A letterpress studio in Detroit.") in Detroit. I used an awl and bone folder to hand-bind the chapbooks. If I'm writing on paper, it's most likely in a Moleskine notebook.

### And what software?

Software I use every day is [Xcode][] for iOS development, [iTerm2][], [Oh My Zsh][oh-my-zsh], [Git][], and [GitHub](https://github.com/rachelhyman "Rachel's GitHub account."). I also use [Postman][], a Chrome plugin, to test API requests, and [Charles Proxy][charles] to intercept requests made in-app. [Mapbox][] is my favorite platform for designing beautiful maps. I use [Sublime Text][sublime-text] for [Rails][] and [JavaScript][] development. Mispy's [twitter_ebooks][] library was integral to building twitter bots. I frequently visit [picresize.com][picresize] to resize pictures for [Slack][] emoji, a very important part of my job. And I use [Spotify][] for music.

The websites for my literary projects are largely running on [Wordpress][]. The [Banango Lit blog](http://banangolit.com/ "The Banango Tumblr site.") and Banango Editions are both on [Tumblr][]. I reluctantly use [Adobe InDesign][indesign] to create the PDFs for Banango Editions.

### What would be your dream setup?

More so than any specific hardware or software, I'd love to have a quiet office space full of natural light with tea and water close at hand. Apart from that, I could use a second Thunderbolt monitor -- iOS development takes up a lot of space and I've always felt the second laptop screen to be awkward and hard to use. I'd also love a perpetual license for Sublime Text so they stop bugging me, and more [Dropbox][] space so I can stop backing up my iPhone photos in 10 different places.
