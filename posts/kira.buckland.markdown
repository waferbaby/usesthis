### Who are you, and what do you do?

[I am](http://www.kirabuckland.com/ "Kira's website.") a voice actress based in Southern California. I provide voice performances for characters in projects such as video games, cartoons, mobile apps, and English dubs of Japanese anime.

### What hardware do you use?

I have a fully enclosed recording booth in my home (made by a company called VocalBooth). Mine is customized, so it's pink! Having the booth turned out to be a lifesaver once the pandemic hit, because I went from doing maybe only 10% of my jobs from home and the rest in-studio, to doing everything from home.

As for microphones, I have two different industry-standard mics available that are used for different purposes based on what the client is looking for. I have the [Neumann TLM 103][tlm-103], a very popular large-diaphragm condenser, and the [Sennheiser MKH 416][mkh-416], which is a shotgun microphone. I like both in their own ways for different applications! My audio interface is an [SSL 2][ssl-2], and I use an external monitor since I have to do a lot of dubbing to picture.

### And what software?

For basic recording and editing of auditions, I just use [Audacity][] -- it's a free, simple, no-frills recording program that I've used for over a decade now so I know it inside and out. However, for mixing, timing, or anything that requires more in-depth editing, I use [Reaper][].

### What would be your dream setup?

Home recording booths get hot and stuffy very quickly, so in a perfect world, I'd have a full recording studio in its own room and with air conditioning. Of course, everything would need to be pink!
