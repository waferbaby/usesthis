### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm Matej Jan, a pixel artist and game developer, better known online as [Retro](https://about.me/retro "Matej's About.me page.") or by my company/blog name [Retronator](https://www.retronator.com/ "Matej's pixel art weblog."). I'm developing a game called [Pixel Art Academy][pixel-art-academy], an adventure game where you become an art student and learn how to draw. I'm a solo developer so I wear a lot of hats - well, all the hats. I studied Computer Science and Education in school while learning how to draw on my own. I wasn't able to go to art school so I want to give a chance to everyone who can't do it in real life to do it in my game.

### What hardware do you use?

I've been a digital nomad for 3 years now so all my life fits into a suitcase and a backpack. To travel light like this I rely heavily on my 13" [iPad Pro][ipad-pro] which servers as my drawing tablet, design notebook, book reader, second display and more. My main workhorse is a 15" [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] that extends the desktop to the iPad with a [Luna Display][luna]. I live happily in the Apple ecosystem so I also have an [iPhone XS][iphone-xs], Apple [Pencil][], [Magic Mouse 2][magic-mouse-2], and [AirPods][]. For movie editing where I need more disk space and quick read/write operations I plug in WD's [My Passport][my-passport] 512 GB SSD drive, whereas the 2 TB [WD Elements][wd-elements-portable] acts as storage for footage and finished videos.

### And what software?

Most of my time is spent in [WebStorm][] where I code my game in [CoffeeScript][] (the game runs in the browser on top of the [Meteor][] platform). I'm very fond of [TextExpander][], a tool for quickly typing out longer text simply by typing its shortcut. I use this extensively in online interactions as well since I have all my social media URLs and other useful links bound to TextExpander shortcuts.

By now I've written most of my own tools to create pixel art, especially [3D Paint][3d-paint], a program to draw pixel art and automatically convert it into a 3D model. Previously I've been a long-time [GIMP][] user, and when I draw pixel art on the iPad I use [Pixaki][pixaki-ios]. To draw concept art on the tablet I use [Linea Sketch][linea-sketch-ios] and I take notes with [Penultimate][penultimate-ios] (which syncs to [Evernote][]). 

I make a lot of GIFs (to post on social media) with [GIF Brewery][gif-brewery] as well as taking video footage directly with [QuickTime][quicktime-pro]. I edit with [iMovie][], which I'm in love with for its power/simplicity ratio and the fact that it's free. For streaming on Twitch I use [OBS][obs-studio].

Special shoutout to [Living Worlds][living-worlds-ios], the most beautiful pixel art screensaver ever, as I always have it running on my iPad when it's not in use.

### What would be your dream setup?

Before I quit my day job to become an indie developer I had a 27" [iMac][] at work and I wouldn't mind returning to that setup. But as a digital nomad, my current setup is pretty much perfection. I'd upgrade my MacBook Pro to the latest model and add an external GPU so I could finally play [Star Citizen][star-citizen] at more than 10 FPS.
