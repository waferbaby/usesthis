### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Ariel Waldman](http://arielwaldman.com/ "Ariel's website."). I focus on making science more open through hacking. I founded [Spacehack.org](http://spacehack.org/ "The Space Hack site."), a directory of ways to participate in space exploration. More recently, I organized [Science Hack Day SF](http://sf.sciencehackday.com/ "A day for haxing on science."), an event that brings together scientists, technologists, designers and people with good ideas to see what they can create in a weekend.

### What hardware do you use?

Being self-employed, I spend a lot of time around the house. So, I own things like a [tea kettle robot][one-touch-tea-maker] for fueling my noon-to-4am work hours, a [cat feeding robot][lebistro-pet-feeder] for not having to keep my fluffy friend hungry when I want to sleep in, and a [bunny bot][nabaztag] for random hacking. Then just some miscellaneous purveyors of entertainment: a [NuMark Pro TT2][pro-tt2] turntable, an [Apple TV2][apple-tv], and an [Airport Express][airport-express].

For my [technosocial wormhole](http://www.ted.com/talks/amber_case_we_are_all_cyborgs_now.html "Amber Case's talk, 'We are all cyborgs now.'") device, I own a [white BlackBerry Torch][torch-9800]. It's an awesome device that has a slide-out physical portrait-mode keyboard I love, tethering capabilities, and a touch screen that can also be navigated through via a trackpad for when you want to wear gloves. My other nomadic devices are an [iPod Touch][ipod-touch] for gaming, a [MacBook Pro 15"][macbook-pro] (sadly pre-unibody for now, but I'll be buying a new one along with an iPad 2 shortly), [Virgin Mobile Mifi 2200][mifi], [Nikon D80][d80] (along with a ton of Lomography cameras) and for hacking fun, an [Arduino][]. But, day-to-day, other than my BlackBerry, the piece of hardware that's closest to me is my MacBook Pro. Though, a little too close for comfort considering I've developed [Toasted Skin Syndrome](http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2010/10/04/toasted-leg-syndrome-warning-for-laptop-users-of/ "A news article about the syndrome.") on my legs as a result of the daily heat exposure.

### And what software?

I'm a bit of a wiki addict, so [PBworks][] helps me manage everything my life: documentation, projects, finances, ideas, health tracking, etc. When it comes to to-do list management, I've discovered that [SimpleGTD][] is the one for me through its bare-bones interface and simple dragging/date adding functionality. I use [LittleSnapper][] to manage screenshots, which has been such a desktop-saver for me by providing one easy library as well as export-to-[Flickr][] functionality. [On The Job][on-the-job] has been a great light-weight app that keeps track of my billable hours. [Audio Recorder][audio-recorder] is another light-weight app I use to record myself when I practice a talk leading up to a conference. [Skype][] receives a lot of use from me, partially because AT&T has no signal in my house, and partially because my boyfriend, [Matt Biddulph](http://matt.biddulph.usesthis.com/ "Matt's interview."), lives in Berlin - so keeping in touch via video between our frequent international travel excursions is great.

Other than that, I use some basics: [Adobe CS4][creative-suite], [Firefox 4.0][firefox], [iChat][] (specifically because of [this security breach on Adium](http://trac.adium.im/ticket/13306 "A bug in Adium regarding blocked contacts.")), [DropBox][], [Tweetie for Mac][twitter-mac], [TextEdit][], etc. I do have one piece of software to plead guilty about: I still use the version of [Microsoft PowerPoint][powerpoint] for Mac from... wait for it... 2001.

### What would be your dream setup?

More robots! An [Iron Man 2-like setup](http://motionographer.com/features/prologue-iron-man-2/ "A video of the UI in Iron Man 2.")! A great 3D printer (but the [AI Feed Scanner](http://www.engadget.com/2009/08/28/movie-gadget-friday-weird-science/ "Ariel's Engadget post including details on the AI Feed Scanner.") from Weird Science would also do). A Nabaztag that alerts me every time there's a near-Earth asteroid. A physical globe that lights up to show where different satellites and/or the ISS currently are. Also, earbuds without wires - I think it's ridiculous that we still have to walk around being physically tethered to our devices to listen to music.
