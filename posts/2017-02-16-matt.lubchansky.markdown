### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Matt Lubchansky](http://matt-lub.com/ "Matt's website."), and I'm an illustrator and cartoonist based in Queens, NY. I've been making my comic [Please Listen to Me](http://www.listen-tome.com/ "Matt's weekly web comic.") once a week since 2010. I'm the Editorial Assistant and a weekly contributor at [The Nib](https://thenib.com/ "A daily comic publication."). I've done freelance illustration work all over the place. I'm also the co-author of [*Dad Magazine*](https://www.amazon.com/Dad-Magazine-Americas-Pop-Culture/dp/1594748640/ "A pop magazine.") (Quirk, 2016).

### What hardware do you use?

At home, I work on a 21.5" 2015 [iMac][] and a [Cintiq Companion 2 tablet][cintiq-companion-2] (13"). I switched to working digitally about 6 years ago and I basically never use paper anymore. I also have a [Toshiba 13334 Chromebook 2][chromebook-2] laying around that I use mostly for writing comics if I feel like I need to get away from my actual desk. When I've got to work out of an office or a friend's house or a hotel room or whatever, I rig up a little studio with the Chromebook and the Companion side by side. I end up writing all my ideas down on my iPhone in the middle of the night mostly.

### And what software?

I try to get all my ideas down in [Google Docs][google-docs] so I've got it on all my devices because I end up working all over the place. Every so often I'll write a script in [TextEdit][] if I need to turn off the internet and just grind for a bit. I lay out panels, letter, sketch, and ink in [Manga Studio EX 4][manga-studio-ex], and then do all my colors in [Photoshop CS6][photoshop]. Manga Studio 4 is pretty damn old and I'm pretty sure it's not even supported anymore, but I got very used to it before I went full-time as an artist and the learning curve of a new program freaks me out. Every so often it'll break and I have to plug a disc drive into my tablet and reinstall it with a physical install disc - one day it's definitely going to die and I'm going to have to go live in the woods.

### What would be your dream setup?

In my wildest dreams I probably have one of those huge [Thunderbolt displays][thunderbolt-display] with a [Mac Pro][mac-pro] and that stupidly massive 27" Cintiq that nobody actually needs. I've been working off a 13" Cintiq for years and having one of the giant ones with a huge articulated arm bolted to the wall sounds nice. For traveling, I'd honestly stick with the setup I have probably!
