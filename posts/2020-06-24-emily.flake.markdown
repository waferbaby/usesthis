### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Emily Flake](http://www.emilyflake.com/ "Emily's website."), I'm a cartoonist, a writer, an illustrator, and a performer (comedy, basically).

### What hardware do you use?

I use Arches 140# hot press paper and the watercolors I'm currently using are LeFrance & Bourgeois, which are as speedy as the name would imply. I like Princeton sable watercolor brushes. Pencil-wise, I'm not picky; I prefer mechanical pencils, usually in the .5 or .3 lead widths. I love Dr. Martin's Black Star ink. I have a clipboard with shitty paper on it that I use in lieu of a sketchbook or diary (though I also have a million little notebooks with like one or two pages written or drawn on. Hope springs eternal).

I also have my own mic (fifty dollar Shure), which feels like it'll come in handy if they ever open up comedy clubs again.

### And what software?

[Photoshop][] and [Word][], primarily

### What would be your dream setup?

If I could have all of this in either a well-appointed shed in the backyard (we would also need a backyard, but we live in Brooklyn so fat chance) or a small apartment nearby I could escape to to work, that would be the dream. Any wealthy patrons out there wanna buy us a backyard?
