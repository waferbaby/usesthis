### Who are you, and what do you do?

Hi, I'm [Robyn Grace Kanner](http://robynkanner.com/ "Robyn's website.")!

I'm currently a UX designer at Amazon within Community where I primarily focus on system design with a strong focus in mobile. I also co-founded and designed [MyTransHealth](http://mytranshealth.com/ "A service for helping trans people link up with appropriate healthcare.") which is a resource dedicated to helping trans people find access to quality healthcare - you can read about it in [The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2016/5/4/11592644/mytranshealth-website-doctors-trans-community-lgbt "The Verge's article about MyTransHealth."), [Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/transgender-healthcare-website-mytranshealth-launches-a-kickstarter-2015-7 "Business Insider's article about MyTransHealth."), and [Upworthy](http://www.upworthy.com/its-hard-being-trans-its-even-harder-when-you-cant-find-a-doctor-a-new-site-hopes-to-fix-that "Upworthy's article about MyTransHealth.") or watch me give a [keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvvMaPRVFb8 "Robyn's MyTransHealth keynote video on YouTube.") on it. In addition, I was invited to The White House to be a part of the 2016 [#WHLGBTQTECH](http://www.recode.net/2016/8/24/12623276/white-house-taps-lgbt-techies "Recode's article about a gathering of LGBTQ tech people at The White House.").

### What hardware do you use?

At work it's pretty standard setup. I use a [standing desk][jarvis-bamboo] and to my right is a [15" MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] that sits on a [Rain Design mStand][mstand]. Directly in front of me is a [27" Cinema Display][cinema-display] and a Leuchtturm1917 notebook for me to sketch in. To my left is a whiteboard with a few black markers. Oh, and I just use a regular 'ol Apple mouse and [keyboard][].

At home I have a [21.5" iMac][imac] that sits on this [Blu Dot Cant Desk][cant]. I typically don't like to use a mouse pad (gets in the way) but sometimes I use this Ugmonk one. Again, regular Apple mouse and keyboard. I back everything up through [Google Drive][google-drive] & this [WD Passport][my-passport-ultra]. I also keep a [Fender Telecaster][telecaster] with a [Blues Jr. amp][blues-junior-iii] near me so that I can do something with my hands when I need to think.

Finally, I have a [12" MacBook][macbook.2] that I mostly use to write on or edit simple front end code in the café.

### And what software?

I learned how to be a designer through print so I still use [Adobe Illustrator][illustrator], [InDesign][], and [Photoshop][] on occasion.

As far designing for the web, I typically use [Sketch][] for screens and then export to [Flinto][] for lo-fi prototypes. I also like [Adobe XD][experience-design] and am looking forward to that program having a little bit more features. On the rare occasion that I need to animate something I'll use [After Effects][after-effects].

To cap things off, I do all of my writing using [Byword][]. The [mobile app][byword-ios] syncs files with desktop which is super convenient.

### What would be your dream setup?

Honestly, it's basically what I have now. I've been a designer for about 10 years and am fortunate to have been able to build a setup that works for me.

I will say this: I didn't start to use a whiteboard up until about a year and a half ago and that might have been my biggest mistake. They've been critical for me to think through a design --- so, I highly suggest picking up one!
