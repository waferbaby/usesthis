### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Phil Gyford](https://www.gyford.com/ "Phil's website.") and I mostly make stuff on the web, often [for paying clients](https://www.well-formed.co.uk/ "Phil's web company."). Over the years I've developed several [personal projects](https://www.gyford.com/phil/about/projects "Phil's projects page.") of which I'm probably best known for [The Diary of Samuel Pepys](https://www.pepysdiary.com/ "Phil's reproduction of Samuel Pepys' diary.") and maybe [Today's Guardian](https://guardian.gyford.com/ "Phil's minimal version of the Guardian.").

Sometimes I do [a bit of acting](https://www.philipgyford.com/ "Phil's acting profile site."), which makes for a great change from sitting alone at a computer.

### What hardware do you use?

I use a MacBook Pro. ["Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015"][macbook-pro], it tells me. I tend to max out a new laptop in terms of processor, memory and storage in the hope it will last as long as possible. My previous MacBook was a "Late 2008" so hopefully this one will see me well into the 2020s, although it's already had a new screen and "top case"...

I usually work with the laptop plugged into [a 24" Dell display][2410] that's nearly a decade old but is still fine. I don't use an external keyboard, mouse or trackpad because I've never had any RSI symptoms from using laptops directly (so far) and this makes for less desktop clutter.

When at my desk I usually have music playing through a pair of [Audioengine A2+][a2-plus] speakers which seem pretty good and aren't too big. I'm not an obsessive audiophile but they do lack bass, being smallish, so I added a [Gemini II subwoofer][gemini-ii], made in Southend-on-Sea, which squats, throbbing, in the limited space under the desk. Sometimes I'll listen on headphones and have a pair of [Audio-Technica ATH-M50s][ath-m50] which I've used enough that I had to [repair the headband](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philgyford/34049458230 "Phil's Flickr photo of his headphone repair work.") a while back.

I also have an [iPhone SE][iphone-se], an [iPad Air 2][ipad-air-2], and a recently-purchased [Apple Watch 4][apple-watch-series-4], which is easily the most dispensible of the three. At the gym I use a [second-generation iPod Shuffle][ipod-shuffle] and [wired earphones][e10c], like a man from the long-forgotten early 21st century.

In the lounge I have a [PlayStation 4][ps4], and that old "Late 2008" MacBook is now in use as our TV set-top box, recording broadcast TV through an eyetv USB stick.

Our home doesn't have any voice-activated devices, and no "smart" or Internet Of Things things, unless you count a ten-year-old [Pure Evoke Flow radio][evoke-flow], which can play internet-based audio streams and has a frustrating interface.

### And what software?

I do most of my work in the [Atom][] text editor with the [vim-mode-plus][] package. I used [MacVim][] for a few years, going through the lengthy process of learning enough arcane key combinations to make [vim][] useful and I've stuck with them after switching to Atom, which was because I wanted something a little more modern. I doubt the limited vim-ness I use makes me any more efficient but it's now hard-wired into my typing bones.

I inevitably use the [Terminal app][terminal] a fair bit in my work and usually manage to stay within the small field of command-line things that don't scare me too much.

There are probably other apps and tools I *should* be using for development but I tend to stay with what I know; it takes me a while to learn new ways of doing things and for them to stick.

When I need to fiddle with images I usually use [Acorn][], which is entirely fine, although last year I had to subscribe to [Photoshop][] for a project so I currently have that as an alternative tool to incredibly under-use.

I read a lot of RSS feeds and some email newsletters, all of which live in [Feedbin][], which I love. That syncs with [Reeder][reeder-ios], which I use on the iPad.

### What would be your dream setup?

A slightly bigger, better display would be quite nice but I don't have enough room on my desk, so everything's fine for the moment.
