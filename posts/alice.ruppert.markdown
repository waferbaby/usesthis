### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Alice](https://bsky.app/profile/malicedafirenze.bsky.social "Alice's Bluesky account.") and I'm a game developer and consultant specialized in representations of horses in video games. Nowadays, the bulk of my work is advising game creators on horse-specific knowledge, and making scope-friendly design choices when it comes to accurate representation of horses and equestrianism in games. I also support in marketing and community management for several games.

### What do you use to get the job done?

I have a desktop PC with an [GTX 1080 Ti GPU][geforce-gtx-1080-ti] and two monitors at home, and I use a [Microsoft Surface Laptop][surface-laptop] when working at the office or at a coworking space. 

For software, I use a lot of [Google Docs][google-docs], because much of my work consists of research, high level design outlines, detailed feedback for animations and more. Other tools that I regularly use for work are [ShotCut][], [Discord][], [Tiktok][], [Slack][], [Photoshop][], [OBS][obs-studio], [Confluence][] and [Miro][]. My horse game website [The Mane Quest](https://www.themanequest.com/ "Alice's website.") is built with [Squarespace][]. The games I work for use [Unity][] or [Unreal][unreal-engine], but I don't really do in-engine work myself nowadays. Oh and I could not use a PC without [ShareX][] for selective screen capturing.

### What would be your dream setup?

I don't really have one! An upgraded PC at some point would be nice I suppose 😄
