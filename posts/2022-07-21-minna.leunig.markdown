### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Minna](http://www.minnaleunig.com/ "Minna's website.") - I'm an artist, more specifically a painter. I split my time between painting works on canvas for exhibitions, and large scale murals (both indoor and outdoor). I've been creative ever since I was tiny, but as I got older I turned more towards art as a way to deal with daily stresses - it became an enjoyable meditative practice of sorts. Eventually it evolved into a way to make a living, and I've been doing this full time now for the last 4 years.

### What hardware do you use?

For murals I use a paint roller to lay down the base coat colour onto a wall, then round cutter brushes to paint the rest of the design. [This][25mm-easy-cutter-paint-brush] is my favourite mural brush - it's great over rough surfaces like brick and helps me to achieve clean outlines which is integral to my work. They also last ages. Catch me with [one of these][600ml-paint-pot] in my hand. I also use large canvas drop sheets instead of plastic ones as you'll have them forever (obviously a lot more sustainable). 

For canvas paintings - I generally paint on good quality stretched linen canvas with acrylic paint. My favourite paint is Matisse Structure - expensive but worth it. I use smaller acrylic bristle pointy tip brushes - no particular brand. To protect the painting once it's finished and dry, I use a spray matt varnish. I usually frame with a dark wood timber float frame - I like dark wood as opposed to black or white as they give my paintings an earthy finish.

I also use a 13 inch [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] (Intel version).

### And what software?

I use [Photoshop CC 2019][photoshop] for design work, mostly to edit hand drawn mural concepts. I also seem to spend most of my life on [Gmail][]. But to be honest, most of my work is pretty analogue.

### What would be your dream setup?

A beautiful big light and plant filled studio with lots of different shelves and storage spaces to keep various materials in order - paint tins and pots, brushes, canvas, paper - etc etc etc. I'd like a huge table in a naturally bright lit position that I could work on large canvases at. A space to the side with some big comfy armchairs, coffee table and kettle for tea breaks and emails. A good speaker system to play music and podcasts through. A bed for my dog Mirka too so she could hang out. I'd also love a van so I could cart my mural gear and canvases around better - right now my car is in perpetual chaos. All in good time!
