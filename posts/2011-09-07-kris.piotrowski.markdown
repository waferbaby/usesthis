### Who are you, and what do you do?

Kris Piotrowski here. I'm the creative director and co-founder of [CAPY](http://www.capybaragames.com/ "The CAPY website."), an indie game studio in Toronto, Canada. My style of creative direction, for lack of a better word, is holistic: I'm deeply involved in all aspects of our game making process, including game design, level design, art and sound direction, as well as writing. I come from a [film and art background](http://imagearts.ryerson.ca/ "The School of Image Arts in Canada."), and cut my teeth doing lead game design and level design at CAPY. My latest projects include [Critter Crunch for PSN](http://vimeo.com/4613180 "The trailer for Critter Crunch for PSN on Vimeo."), Clash of Heroes for [Nintendo DS][might-and-magic-clash-of-heroes] and [PSN](http://vimeo.com/4613180 "The trailer for Clash Of Heroes for PSN on Vimeo.") and [Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP][sword-and-sworcery-ios] for iPhone+iPad.

### What hardware do you use?

I spend most of my time glued to my two year old [13" MacBook][macbook]. Because we develop for a handful of different consoles and devices, I find myself orbiting around our [PS3][] and [Xbox 360][xbox-360] kits, iPads, iPhones and recently, [Vita kits][vita]. I use one of [these little guys][usb-snes-classic-controller] sometimes, for kicks. I also live inside my [Grado SR80][sr80i] whenever I need to focus. I always have moleskin notebook nearby, just in case. When I need to motivate the troops, I [point this piece of hardware](http://www.moretoyguns.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Session_ID=fccb7a37f357f0de93c7d5165085ee6f&Screen=PROD&Store_Code=4T&Product_Code=23256-IM&Category_Code=cap101 "A toy gun.") in their faces. Highly recommend it to anyone who needs to show someone who's boss.

### And what software?

I spend a lot of time in [Google Docs][google-docs], which our teams use to keep track of and modify design documentation and spreadsheets. It's a great way to share ideas and make sure everyone is up to date. I also use in-house editors and tools to work on our game content and tweak variables and stuff. I use [Photoshop][] to scribble notes all over our beautiful concept art and to make laughable concept art of my own. I run [Boot Camp][boot-camp] [Windows XP][windows-xp] on my MacBook mainly to work on our game prototypes... but also to run [X-COM][ufo-enemy-unknown]. I use [Wunderlist][] to keep track of my tasks and [Tweetie][twitter-mac] to post [fart-based jokes](http://twitter.com/#!/krispiotrowski/status/85371628472635394 "Kris' tweet about his cat.") on [Twitter][]. I use the [Korg Monotron][monotron] to [transform normal sounds into badass synths](http://www.flickr.com/photos/51277380@N08/5278986148/ "A photo of Kris making the audios."). I use [DOSBOX][] to emulate X-COM. I also use [iTunes][] to listen to psychedelic rock and roll.

### What would be your dream setup?

When I get super rich, I'm going to demand [Optimal Sleeping and Working Arrangements](http://theheavenlyhome.com/kids-bunk-beds-with-desk-the-optimal-sleeping-and-working-arrangement/ "The concept of bunk beds with desks built in."). And [this chair][cocon].
