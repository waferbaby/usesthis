### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Joe Grand](https://twitter.com/joegrand "Joe's Twitter account."), aka Kingpin. I'm a computer engineer, hardware hacker, product designer, teacher, advisor, runner, daddy, honorary doctor, [TV host](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_This! "The Wikipedia entry for Prototype This!, a tv show."), member of legendary hacker group [L0pht Heavy Industries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L0pht "The Wikipedia entry for the hacking group L0pht."), and the proprietor of [Grand Idea Studio](http://www.grandideastudio.com/ "Joe's hardware company.").

Most of my life revolves around creating, exploring, and manipulating electronic systems. I specialize in the reverse engineering and security analysis of hardware products and enjoy [teaching others](http://www.grandideastudio.com/hardware-hacking-training/ "Joe's hardware hacking courses.") about how products can be forced into doing things they weren't designed to do. I also enjoy inventing my own products to share with the world, sometimes [useful, practical things](http://www.grandideastudio.com/portfolio/do-it-yourself/ "A list of Joe's DIY hardware projects.") and sometimes [ridiculous, goofy things](http://www.grandideastudio.com/portfolio/miscellany/ "A list of Joe's sillier projects."), depending on my mood.

### What hardware do you use?

My main machine is a [15" MacBook Pro][macbook-pro]. I'm often on the move, sharing my physical location between my lab, house, hotels, and classrooms. I have an aversion to intentionally storing my data on other people's computers ("[the cloud](https://www.xkcd.com/1506/ "An XKCD comic about cloud storage.")"), so I've traded the power of a desktop machine for the portability of a laptop and the convenience of having access to everything I need no matter where I am.

My primary analysis tool is the [Agilent DSO7054A digital storage oscilloscope][dso7054a]. Nothing beats being able to see what electrical signals are actually doing at a given point in time, especially if you're trying to figure out how a system is operating or why it isn't. For listening in on and decoding communications between components or subsystems within a product, I use a [Saleae Logic Pro 8][logic-pro-8] logic analyzer. My [Fluke 287 multimeter][287] and [HP E3630A][e3630a] triple-output DC power supply are also constant companions.

At my workbench, I use a [Metcal MX-500P][mx-500p] soldering system and [Vision Engineering Mantis Elite][mantis-elite] stereo inspection microscope. For rework and parts scavenging, I'll choose between a [Weller WHA900][wha900] hot air station, [Hakko FR-300][fr-300] desoldering tool, or Chip Quik SMD removal alloy, depending on the target component's package type and location. For extracting data from and programming data into microcontrollers and memory devices, I rely on my [Xeltek SuperPro 501S][superpro-501s] universal device programmer.

For hacking on and exploring embedded systems, I use a variety of electronic modules and platforms like the [Propeller][], [BASIC Stamp][basic-stamp], [Arduino][], and [BeagleBone][beagleboard]. I also use a whole bunch of tools built by hackers for hackers including the [JTAGulator][], [Bus Pirate][bus-pirate], [Bus Blaster][bus-blaster], ChipWhisperer, and [HackRF One][hackrf-one].

For rapid prototyping and desktop manufacturing, I employ two main tools: A [T- Tech QuickCircuit 5000][qc-5000] PCB prototyping system for creating circuit boards and a [MakerBot Thing-o-Matic][thing-o-matic] for 3D printing of project enclosures and tchotchkes.

### And what software?

My primary operating system is [macOS][] and I use the standard complement of provided applications, most often [Mail][], [Keynote][], [Pages][], [Numbers][], and [TextEdit][]. I like staying in the native environment as much as possible, but use [VMware Fusion][vmware-fusion] to run Windows and [Ubuntu][] when I need a sandbox to play in or to work with engineering software not supported by macOS.

I'm the most efficient when I focus on one task at a time, so I use [Things][] to keep my to-do lists in order and to help plan my day.

Even though I generally work alone, there's something to be said for human interaction. [Colloquy][] for [IRC](https://xkcd.com/1782/ "An XKCD comic about team chat.") keeps me sane and in touch with many of my friends.

For schematic capture and circuit board layout, I use [Altium Designer][altium-designer]. I designed my first professional circuit board with [Protel EasyTrax][easytrax] for DOS in 1996 and have followed the progression of the tool since then.

For version control and dealing with Git repositories, I use [SourceTree][] coupled with [Beyond Compare][beyond-compare].

Depending on what I'm currently working on, I'll use other software tools like [Microchip MPLAB IDE][mplab-ide] with [XC8][], [CodeWarrior][], [Quartus Prime][quartus-prime], [OpenOCD][], [gdb][], and/or [IDA][].

For [video demonstrations](https://www.youtube.com/user/kingpinempire "Joe's videos on YouTube.") of projects and products, I film with my [iPhone 4][iphone-4] and edit with [iMovie][]. I'm notoriously bad at video production and tend to be more concerned that the information gets conveyed properly than how good it ends up looking.

### What would be your dream setup?

I've always wanted to have some sort of underground secret laboratory. I'm completely happy with the resources I have above ground, but a subterranean lair would be awesome.
