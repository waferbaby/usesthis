### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm Eugene Marshall, one half of [Arcanist Press](https://arcanistpress.com/ "A tabletop games studio."). We create tabletop roleplaying game content, mostly for Dungeons & Dragons. I write and edit our content, as well as manage our promotion and social media. My spouse handles layout and art direction. Together, we've created [_Ancestry & Culture: An Alternative to Race in 5e_](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/314622 "Eugene's D&D book about race and ancestry."), a D&D supplement that began life as a successful [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/eugenemarshall/ancestry-and-culture-an-alternative-to-race-in-5e/ "Eugene's Kickstarter for his D&D supplement.") and is now a critically acclaimed top seller on DriveThruRPG. In addition, I am a lead writer for [Sigil Entertainment](https://sigil.info/ "An art/game studio."), an art and game studio that creates content for Savage Worlds. 

In my capacity as a game designer and marketer, I'm also the showrunner of a Twitch live play show called [Sigil Spotlight](https://www.twitch.tv/sigil_entertainment "A group of RPG industry creators streaming on Twitch."). We are a majority POC and LGBTQ+ community of tabletop roleplaying game industry creators. Each session, we feature the game content of one or more of the creators at the table. I run these sessions as well as the channel. The videos are [archived on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI8Y9H22eZN6DDiklpQnSAFZRcaxoqTwY "An archive of Sigil Spotlight recording on YouTube.") as well.

And then, of course, I have my day job as a [university college professor](https://sites.google.com/site/eugenemarshall/ "Eugene's homepage.") working on early modern European philosophy; I've produced three academic philosophy books.

### What hardware do you use?

My primary machine is a Retina 5K, 27-inch, 2019 [iMac][] with a 3.7 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i5, 16 GB RAM, a 500 GB SSD, and a Radeon Pro 580X. I have a second monitor as well, an [LG 27UD58-B 27-inch 4K UHD][27ud58-b]. Because I stream, I also have a [Blue Yeti mic][yeti] on a boom and use the [SR80e open ear headphones][sr80e] from Grado Labs. 

I also have a 13 inch [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] at a standing desk in the other room, with another LG 4K monitor, because I can't sit at a desk all day. I actually have the [Kickstarter model cardboard standing desk][kickstarter-standing-desk] from Chairigami. I've had mine since 2014 and it still does the job. When I'm on the go, I like the Paper Mate Mirado Black Warrior Pencils, Black, HB #2 and I carry them and my laptop in a [Targus Ascend backpack][ascend], which I like because it has a low profile. 

Ha, and I almost forgot my most important ingredient: coffee. I've had a subscription to Blue Bottle Coffee ever since they bought my all time favorite coffee subscription company, Tonx. Before Tonx I drank Intelligentsia. I use a [Hario ceramic coffee dripper][v60] to make pour-over coffee with the help of an [Elementi gooseneck electric Kettle][electric-gooseneck-kettle].

### And what software?

My software is pretty boring; I gave up being adventurous when I had kids and couldn't find the time to hack Linux anymore. So now I use the latest macOS and all the default apps - [Notes][], [Reminders][], [Calendar][], [Mail][], etc. I have three different Mac machines (including my machine at my university office) and an [iPhone XS Max][iphone-xs-max], and I rely on the out of the box syncing across platforms.

For word processing, I use [Word][]. My spouse does the bulk of the layout, but I occasionally make edits, so I use the [Adobe Creative Suite][creative-suite] to do that, mostly [InDesign][]. For game promotions, I use [Hootsuite][] and [Discord][]. To stream, I use [Streamlabs][], now that it is thankfully out for Mac, and [Zoom][]. I occasionally use [Pocket][] to read stuff I've saved, but my library of things to read always grows faster than I can read the stuff, sadly. On my Macs, I also use [BetterSnapTool][] and the [Time Out app][time-out] from Dejal to schedule breaks, which I will otherwise forget to take.

### What would be your dream setup?

I am incredibly privileged, so I am actually pretty close to my dream setup for my work applications. I'd welcome a really nice, expensive chair, like a [Herman Miller Aeron][aeron], with a keyboard mount and mouse tray at hand, both adjustable to reduce ergonomic stress on my wrists. I wish my area had gigabit internet, even though I know I don't need anything faster than I have (400 Mbps). Otherwise, I'm pretty happy with what I have!
