### Who are you, and what do you do?

Hi! My name is [Kris Howard](https://krishoward.org/ "Kris' website."), and I'm a manager in the [Developer Relations team](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/evangelists/ "The developer relations team at AWS.") at [Amazon Web Services][aws]. I lived in Sydney for the past 19 years, but at the end of August 2020 I relocated to Munich, Germany with my partner (in the middle of a pandemic!). I do a lot of public speaking at [meetups and tech conferences](https://krishoward.org/#talks "Kris' talks."), which used to be in person (involving a fair amount of travel) but nowadays is mostly online. I started my career as a web developer, and I'm still maintaining the [Roald Dahl fan site](https://www.roalddahlfans.com/ "Kris' Roald Dahl fan site.") I built in university in 1996 as well as a [personal blog](https://www.web-goddess.org "Kris' weblog.") that dates from 2000. I am also an [award-winning knitter](https://www.web-goddess.org/archive/11211 "Kris' post about winning knitting awards.") as well as a [sewist](https://www.threadsmagazine.com/2012/10/11/sewer-vs-sewist "An article about the words 'sewer' and 'sewist'.") of clothes for myself and my partner. Lately I've been experimenting with [streaming knitting on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/krishoward_aws "Kris' Twitch account.").

### What hardware do you use?

One of the criteria for finding somewhere to live in Munich was a place where I could have a combination office and craft room. Thankfully, we found one and I've been busy setting it up now that our furniture finally arrived on the boat from Australia.

On my work desk, I've got a 13" 2017 [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] that is well due for an upgrade. It sits on a [Thermaltake Massive V20 laptop stand][massive-v20] for extra cooling and plugs into an Alogic USB-C hub. Plugged into that, I've got a [Dell 24 monitor][p2419h], a [papalook HD webcam][af925], a [Neewer microphone][usb-microphone-kit], and an [HP Elite keyboard][ku-1156]. (It's a German keyboard so a few of the keys are different, but I've mapped it to the layout I'm used to.) I've also got an original [Apple Magic Mouse][magic-mouse], which I love and will mourn when it finally dies. For extra light when streaming, I've got a [Neewer LED ring light][tabletop-10-inch-usb-led-ring-light] as well as Dimmable Bi-Colour LED Light on a stand. When my [AirPods][] aren't charged up, I use [Bose QuietComfort 25 noise-cancelling headphones][quietcomfort-25] (which are the only over-ear ones I've found comfortable on my giant head). I've also got a 3rd gen [Echo Dot][echo-dot] (still set up for Australia) as well as a 1st gen [Google Home Mini][google-home-mini] (set up for Germany). When I'm working, I sit in a ridiculous [Secretlab TITAN D.Va gaming chair][titan]. (No, I don't play Overwatch, but it was in stock and I liked the pink!)
  
 For personal computing, I stick within the Apple ecosystem. I've got a 13" 2015 [MacBook Air][macbook-air] that's still kicking, though I did replace the battery a few months back. I also have an 11" [iPad Pro][ipad-pro] that I use with a [Logitech Slim Folio Pro][slim-folio-pro] and [Apple Pencil][pencil] for travel. I also spend way too much time staring at my [iPhone 11][iphone-11]. We've also just got a [Brother 2750 multi-function printer][mfc-l2750dw], which I use for printing reams of German bureaucracy and the occasional sewing pattern.
 
On the craft side of the office, I recently got an [IKEA Bekant electric sit/stand desk][bekant]. At one end sits my [Janome Skyline S5 computerised sewing machine][skyline-s5]. At the other end is a large 24"x36" Fiskars self-healing cutting mat that I use with a [KAI rotary cutter][rx-45]. (I can raise the desk up to be more comfortable when standing and cutting!) My Good Scissors are Soft Canary dressmaker shears.

For knitting, I pretty much always use circular needles. I've got a set of [addiClick interchangeables][addiclick-basic], as well as an assortment of addi Turbos and KnitPros. I prefer knitting with natural fibers, and my current project is using Lana Grossa Cool Wool Fine 100% merino wool. On the rare occasion I buy yarn in a skein rather than a ball, I have a [hand-cranked ball winder][ybw-a] that I use with a swift.
  
Beyond that stuff, I read books on a [Kindle Paperwhite][kindle-paperwhite]. I like being able to plan my work week on paper, and for that I use a Stalogy Editor's Series notebook in a Hobonichi Techo 2016 Hello Kitty cover that a friend brought me from Japan. On my wrist I wear a [Withings Steel HR][steel-hr], which I love because I get the benefits of a smart watch (activity tracking, notifications) in a form factor that actually looks like a watch and only needs charging every few weeks.
  
### And what software?

My working day is generally spent in [Firefox][], [Slack][], [Amazon Chime][chime], and the [Microsoft Office Suite][office]. If I need to give a presentation, I tend to use [PowerPoint][] for internal work-related ones and [Keynote][] for external or personal. I use AWS for all my coding demos, of course! I also use [Canva][] to occasionally create graphics. For streaming to [Twitch][], I use [OBS][obs-studio] on my laptop and [OBS Camera][camera-for-obs-studio-ios] on my iPhone.

My personal sites run on [Wordpress][] that I host on [Amazon Lightsail][lightsail]. For updating them, I use [Atom][] with its built-in [GitHub][] support. If I need to do anything with images, I use [Acorn][]. If I need a terminal, I use [iTerm2][].

I was an early [Gmail][] adopter and I use [Google Drive][google-drive] for sharing docs with my partner. We also have a shared [Todoist][] to-do list and a [Google Calendar][google-calendar] for organising our life. We also use [YNAB][] (You Need a Budget) for managing our joint finances. I store passwords in [mSecure][]. I also use [Contacts+][contacts-plus] to augment my address book, because it allows you to add tags and arbitrary notes to people and then search on them later. (I'm terrible with names so it helps to know where and when I met someone.) I've built a custom Mac [Automator][] workflow that I can invoke from a [LinkedIn][] profile to add the person to my Contact+ address book. I use [Tweetdeck][] in the browser and [Tweetbot][tweetbot-ios] on my iPhone for managing Twitter, and [The Old Reader][the-old-reader] for reading RSS feeds. (I'm still bitter about the loss of Google Reader, which I loved. 😭) I listen to music and podcasts on [Spotify][].

For my crafting, I'm a big fan of (and contributor to) FreeSewing, an Open Source [Javascript library][freesewing] for creating made-to-measure sewing patterns. You just upload your measurements, select some configuration options, and generate a completely custom pattern to print out. Genius! For knitting, I use [Ravelry][] to record all of my project data and find new patterns to knit. (I'm "webgoddess" over there if you want to friend me.) I use [Notability][notability-ios] on my iPad to organise my knitting patterns and mark up PDFs with the Pencil. I also occasionally use [Knit Counter Lite][knit-counter-lite-ios] on my iPhone, if I'm knitting a pattern that requires keeping track of rows.  

Lastly, I just want to give a shout out to [Clue][clue-ios]. If you menstruate, it's a great way to track your cycle and get insight into why you feel the way you do.

### What would be your dream setup?

It's about time to upgrade my work machine, and man, what I wouldn't give for an M1 MacBook Pro! (I think it's a longshot though.) I've also got cables running everywhere, and I'd love for something to just hide all that.
 
Beyond that I'm pretty happy, especially considering we just had an international move. Sure, there's still a lot of stuff in storage in Australia that I miss, most notably my beloved Singer Overlocker and most of my knitting and sewing pattern books. I'd love to have a babylock Coverlock machine someday. I also recently joined a Facebook group for sewists who use projectors to project patterns directly onto fabric, so I'm watching eBay and Facebook Marketplace for an Epson UST. But I've got more than enough to keep me occupied for now..
