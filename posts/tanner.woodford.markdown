### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Tanner Woodford](https://tannerwoodford.com/ "Tanner's website.), founder and executive director of the [Design Museum of Chicago](http://designchicago.org/ "A museum in Chicago."). I believe design has the capacity to fundamentally improve the human condition. In 2012, I opened Chicago's first pop-up design museum as a way to celebrate  the impact of design while making it accessible to everybody. I also teach a class at the [School of the Art Institute of Chicago](http://saic.edu/ "A design school in Chicago.") called "Design Thinking for Social Change," where each student selects a social issue, spends a semester making a research book about it, then tries to make an actual impact by solving a self-identified problem. In the time between these two gigs, [I paint typographic murals](http://tannerwoodford.com/murals/ "Tanner's murals page.").

### What hardware do you use?

Here's a short selection of a long list of hardware I interact with on the daily.

- Drafting table once owned by [Daniel Burnham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Burnham "The Wikipedia entry for Daniel Burnham.")
- 2006 Toyota Corolla Sedan (silver)
- [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] (15-inch)
- Apple [iPhone X][iphone-x]
- Silhouette [CAMEO 3][cameo-3] with roll feeder
- #4 Scalpel (#20 blade)
- Sony [MDR-V6][] studio monitor headphones
- Gerber [EAB][] folding pocket knife
- Selection of rulers, t-squares, brushes, and hand tools

### And what software?
