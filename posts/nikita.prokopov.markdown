### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is Nikita Prokopov, I'm a software developer from Russia. As with any software developer, my hobbies include computers, software, hardware, but also design, cinema and even illustration. I also occasionally blog [about software](http://tonsky.me/ "Nikita's software weblog.") and [about UX](https://grumpy.website/ "Nikita's UX weblog."). And watch a lot of movies too. I mean, [a lot](https://letterboxd.com/tonsky/ "Nikita's Letterboxd account.").

### What hardware do you use?

13" [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] (early 2015) — perfect form factor, not so good performance.

My monitor is a [Dell P2415Q][p2415q], a 24" 4K display which occasionally gives me headaches, but when it works the image is perfect. I've realised I can't look at non-retina displays anymore.

My keyboard is a [Microsoft Sculpt][sculpt-ergonomic-keyboard] which is surprisingly ergonomic and very good for my hands. Looks nice too. I only wish it was mechanical.

I use an old [Magic Trackpad][magic-trackpad] which still does the job just fine. I'm so used to trackpads I can't imagine why people would voluntarily choose mice over them. But only Apple trackpads count - all Windows ones are plain terrible.

For illustration I have the 12.9" [iPad Pro][ipad-pro] with the [Apple Pencil][pencil]. 13 inches turns out to be a bit bigger than I'd like, so I guess Steve Jobs was right all along, and 10" is a perfect size for a tablet.

My phone is an old [Nexus 5X][nexus-5x], which is almost unusable with today's apps, either because of storage size (16 GB is NOT enough anymore) or performance. I hope it dies any time soon so I can justify buying something newer.

My go-to headphones are wireless [Bose QuietComfort 35's][quietcomfort-35], which are fantastic for when you need to concentrate or you're just tired of noise from a plane or train. Works seamlessly with both the MacBook and the Nexus.

For entertainment I'm super happy with the [Nintendo Switch][switch.2], which has a multitude of great games, and a [Xgimi H1][h1.2] LED projector. Much bigger image than any TV would give you, perfect for immersive experiences.

### And what software?

*Big ones*: [VS Code][visual-studio-code] for coding. [GitKraken][] for version control. [iA Writer][ia-writer] for notes and drafts (yes, I'm writing this in iA Writer). [Chrome][] for browsing, although I'd love to move away from it some day - unfortunately everything else is either slow or unreliable. [Dropbox][] for files. [Figma][] for design. It works way better for me than Sketch, and has much more advanced functions and interactions, UX-wise. On the iPad I use [ProCreate][procreate-ios] for illustration almost exclusively.

*Smaller ones*: [Spectacle][] for window management. [Karabiner Elements][karabiner] and Ukelele to [adjust my own keyboard layout](http://tonsky.me/blog/cursor-keys/ "Nikita's post about cursor keys and key mapping."). [Tomato One][tomato-one] for Pomodoro. [Noizio][] for generating white noise while I'm working. I used to use [f.lux][] but newer [macOSes][macos] have its functions built-in.

I use my own tools too: [Fira Code](http://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode "Nikita's coding font.") is my go-to coding font, [AnyBar][] is my go-to status indicator.

*Nice to haves*: [Shush][] for conference calls. [HandBrake][] for occasional video re-encoding. [InsomniaX][] for those rare occasions when I need my Mac not to sleep for some reason. [Day-O][] because yes, I believe when you click on your date/time clock in the macOS status bar you shold see a small calendar for the current month. Oh! And [Wallcat][] for a new desktop wallpaper every day.

### What would be your dream setup?

6-core i9 in a 13" MacBook Pro shell with 120Hz refresh rate & wide color gamut. I'm happy if it only had integrated video though. But it must have MagSafe, not USB, for power.

An 32:9 ultrawide external retina display. I'm even willing to power it with three Thunderbolt cables, just give me one.

Split ortholinear mechanical keyboard ([Let's Split][lets-split] or [Iris][] seem fine, and yes, I've already ordered one).

[iPad mini][ipad-mini]-sized Magic Trackpad with Apple Pencil support.
