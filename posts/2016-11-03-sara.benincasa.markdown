### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Sara Benincasa](http://www.sarabenincasa.com/ "Sara's website."), and I'm an author and comedian. I've written five books and am meant to be working on a sixth at present. I've also written one pilot and am working on another. I recently completed the first draft of a feature adaptation of my third book, "DC Trip."

### What hardware do you use?

I bludgeon all who oppress me with a large wooden club I carved myself. The runes upon it summon angels and demons alike. I also have a [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro].

### And what software?

I use [Final Draft][final-draft] and [Microsoft Word][word] and [Safari][].

### What would be your dream setup?

I suppose I'd have access to nature quite easily right outside my door. I'd then ignore it at a comfortable desk with an ergonomic chair that was very comfortable.
