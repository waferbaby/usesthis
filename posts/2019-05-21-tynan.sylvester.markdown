### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Tynan Sylvester](https://twitter.com/TynanSylvester "Tynan's Twitter account."), an indie game developer. My main project is [RimWorld][], a space colony simulation game focused on story generation. I previously worked on [BioShock Infinite][bioshock-infinite], and I wrote a game design book called _Designing Games: A Guide to Engineering Experiences_.

### What hardware do you use?

I've got a giant home-built desktop PC and a Dell [XPS-15][] laptop I use for development. My monitor is an old Dell 24-incher; I use a Razer DeathAdder mouse and a Razer Black Widow mechanical keyboard. More important than all of this, perhaps is my chair - a Herman Miller [Embody][] that makes it comfortable and not horribly unhealthy to work for extended periods.

### And what software?

RimWorld is developed in the [Unity][] engine - still on old version 5.6. For coding, I use [Visual Studio Code][visual-studio-code]. I use [Git][] for source control, [Photoshop][] for 2D art, [Audition][] for audio editing, [Premiere][] for video editing, and our team coordinates on [Google Docs][google-docs] and [Skype][]. My Photoshop is still on version CS6, since Adobe refuses to sell permanent licenses now and they haven't added any must-have features.

### What would be your dream setup?

RimWorld's been pretty successful, so if I needed something else I'd definitely buy it. But I'm not one for new or fancy tools - I've been using the same tools for many years now. For me, familiar tools reduce disruption in the design process that I actually care about. I suppose my setup could be a bit dreamier if you put it in a New York penthouse or something; that'd be fun.
