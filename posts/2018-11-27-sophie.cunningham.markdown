#### Who are you, and what do you do?

[I'm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Cunningham "Sophie's Wikipedia entry.") a writer - I've had four books published and have two more on the way - and a sometime artist. I also teach, do some arts administration and public speaking.

#### What hardware do you use?

I have a [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] which I use most of the time for almost everything I do. I used to hook that up to a larger screen but I don't much anymore as I tend to move around a lot when I work (stand, sit, lie on the couch, work at the kitchen bench etc). I have a separate keyboard and mouse at my office which I use if I'm there. I use the MacBook for writing books, lectures, class planning, lots of emailing and carrying on with calendar and diary management. 

I also have a [iPad Pro][ipad-pro] (10") which I use for art and reading but when I travel I use a portable keyboard and then do email and other basic tasks using the iPad. I am particularly keen on the iPad when I'm giving lectures as I can hold it like a sheath of paper. 

I have an [iPhone 6S Plus][iphone-6s-plus], which I like because the camera is good, and because the screen is large enough that I can read emails and use for social media (which I am currently trying to cut down drastically on). My sight is getting worse as I get older. I don't think I could handle a small phone anymore. I have inherited an [Apple Watch][apple-watch] which I use mainly for exercise purposes though getting messages on it is useful. I also use a standing desk, a planning desk, paper and and paint I carry a drawing pad and drawing pens with me. 

#### And what software?

I have [Microsoft Office][office] and use [Word][] a lot. Partly out of habit and partly because most people I work for/with use it. When I'm writing my books I use [Scrivener][] which I love and am quite evangelical about. Whenever I teach I tell other writers to use it. I have tried software for things like planning, and work flow management, but they don't tend to stick. I'm basically pretty happy with Word/[Notes][]/Scrivener and lost interest in software which requires me to change my working habits. I use [Saasu][] for my accounts which I do on my MacBook. Oh, and I use [iCal][] to nudge me, and alarms for the same reason. 

I use the Notes function on my phone a lot. I use the camera constantly as a prompt for writing and art. I sometimes use the microphone on the phone to record things. I use Planets (for fun) and the digital edition of Pizzey & Knight Birds of Australia (birdwatching). 

I use [Procreate][procreate-ios] on my iPad Pro for drawing and creating images. [iBooks][ibooks-ios] for reading. [Paprika][paprika-ios] for keeping track of recipes. [Instagram][instagram-ios] for [@sophtreeofday](https://www.instagram.com/sophtreeofday/ "Sophie's Instagram account for tree photos.") on which I post a picture of a tree everyday. I've deleted [Facebook][], [Twitter][] etc. from my various devices, but I still check into the websites now and then. 

#### What would be your dream setup?

I confess I have a partner who thinks about these things on my behalf a lot, so I suspect I am pretty close. I suppose my dream set up would involve a bit more physical space. I could spread out with painting, and have a larger desk for writing (i.e. I could throw books around on) and which was also adjustable. And I'd like more storage/shelves etc. But when it comes to computers and devices I'm extremely well set up.
