### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm a writer and stand up comedian. My new humor collection, [_I'm More Dateable than a Plate of Refried Beans_](https://www.chroniclebooks.com/collections/new-1/products/im-more-dateable-than-a-plate-of-refried-beans "Ginny's humour book."), is out now! I also [tweet](https://twitter.com/ginnyhogan_ "Ginny's Twitter account.") an absurd amount.

### What hardware do you use?

I have a 2018 13-inch [MacBook Air][macbook-air]. I don't even use an external keyboard or mouse, much do the chagrin of my wrists.

### And what software?

As a writer, I do almost everything out of [Google Docs][google-docs]. I find it easiest to share, and I far prefer it to [Microsoft Word][word], although I think I'm in the minority here. I also use [Final Draft][final-draft] for writing scripts, because that's the industry standard. I'm not sure this counts as "software," but I find the TikTok app really great for editing videos.

### What would be your dream setup?

To not have a computer, honestly. I'm not sure how I'd share my writing - maybe photos of pages written in a notebook? I hate technology.
