### Who are you, and what do you do?

Hello! My name is [Jake Myler](https://jakemyler.weebly.com/ "Jake's website."), and I work in comic book illustration, video game concepts and, most recently, keyboard keycap design of all things! I guess I have many art-related pursuits, but if I think I can pull it off, I'll definitely give it a shot! Comics I've made include the graphic novels Undertown and Orphan Blade, and a series of Fraggle Rock comics (among others)! I've worked for 12 years in casual gaming for a Seattle-based game studio.

### What hardware do you use?

I split my work between a big ol' PC computer that has the best graphics card I could find (which for me was an i7 CyberPower PC with a [GeForce RTX 3070][geforce-rtx-3070]) and attached to that I use a [Wacom Cintiq Pro 24][cintiq-pro] to draw with. Especially during the pandemic I've been stuck at home, so I find it important to move around and not just be at the desk from dawn till dusk. So I take my [iPad Pro][ipad-pro] (11-inch) if I need a change of scenery and take a drawing to the couch or the kitchen counter.

Also because music is important to listen to while drawing I have a very old pair of AIAIAI headphones, which are great because they're lightweight and I can wear them all day without fatigue.

### And what software?

I use [Photoshop][] on my computer and [Procreate][procreate-ios] on my iPad! That's pretty much it!

### What would be your dream setup?

I think after many years and a year and a half of working exclusively from home I've pretty much achieved my dream setup. The only thing that could be better would be to have an extra studio to paint in and be messy. I don't really paint with real media, but that's entirely because I hate having to set it up and then put it away when I'm done. It'd be cool to have everything in a room and just leave it there when the painting is finished! So for now I keep my paints digital and there's no cleanup.
