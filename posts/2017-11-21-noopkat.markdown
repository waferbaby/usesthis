### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Suz Hinton](http://noopkat.com/ "Suz's website."). I was born and raised in Melbourne, Australia, where I slowly learned to embrace the nerd that I am. I moved to the USA 7 years ago, and am currently based in New York City. I work as a software developer in developer relations at Microsoft.
 
I partner with both companies and communities to help them make the most of [Azure Cloud Services][azure] and other Microsoft tools. It's a combination of pair programming, public speaking, documentation writing, and building interesting prototypes. It's fast paced learning and teaching; I never run out of projects that I want to do.
 
Off duty, I maintain several well loved JavaScript hardware libraries, and build electronic contraptions to delight others with. I really like reading technical papers, and geeking out about frontend performance and accessibility. I also [live code on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/noopkat "Suz's Twitch account.") most weekends, with a quickly growing audience tuning in to watch.

### What hardware do you use?

I work from home, from my study. I have a cheap [IKEA "desk"][linnmon] that I bought over 5 years ago. I sit on a half price refurbed [Aeron Chair][aeron] which supports my back really well during many hours of working. I stare at an [Acer K272 27" monitor][k272hl] all day. I use a [Perixx PERMICE-712][perimice-712] wireless mouse], and a much beloved [Leopold 660M][fc660m] mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX brown switches. I currently have lavender keycaps installed. This keyboard is my pride and joy for writing software.

I use two different computers. My work computer is a [Microsoft Surface Book][surface-book], and my personal computer is a [13" 2016 Apple MacBook Pro][macbook-pro].

For streaming, I use a [Blue Yeti][yeti] microphone, two [Logitech C920 Pro][hd-pro-webcam-c920] webcams, and [OBS Studio][obs-studio] streaming software.

My 3D printer is a [Printrbot Plus Metal][printrbot-plus] with dual extrusion and a heated bed. I run it wirelessly using [OctoPrint][] running on a [Raspberry Pi][raspberry-pi]. My soldering iron is a [Hakko FX-888D][fx-888d].

My coffee grinder is a [Bodum BISTRO][bistro], and the coffee making process is done with an [Aeropress][]. I import Bonsoy soy milk because I am a weirdo about the taste of soy milk in coffee. It's my one food extravagance, because outside of coffee I'm mostly disinterested in food.

### And what software?

I use [vim][] as a code editor. On my MacBook, [iTerm][iterm2] is my terminal of choice. On my Surface Book, I live in [Bash on Ubuntu][windows-subsystem-for-linux] running within [ConEmu][]. I use mostly [Chrome][] and [Edge][edge.2] as my browsers. [OneNote][] contains my entire life. In there I store my daily task lists, blog post ideas, long term projects, career goals, and almost everything else you can imagine. I also can't live without my [Outlook][] calendar, so I know where I need to be at all times. I listen to music daily with the [Spotify][] app. My favorite headphones to listen with are [Sennheiser PX200 IIs][px-200-ii].
 
My favorite software languages to code in are [JavaScript][] and [Python][].

### What would be your dream setup?

Ideally I'd like to work from a room with very large windows and trees outside. I love watching birds and other animals while I'm thinking. I would love a minimalist, white desk (a real one). An additional, separate work desk for soldering and making messy things would be so amazing. I currently program and solder on the same desk, so it's not very roomy or practical. I really like the idea of having multiple screens, like in a clichéd hollywood hacker movie. Right now I don't have the space for many screens. I would fill the rest of the space with plants and the art of my friends. Most of all, I relish a quiet environment. I have adapted to noisy New York City, but love and miss true silence all the same!
