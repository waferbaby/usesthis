### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Lynn Fisher](https://lynnandtonic.com/ "Lynn's website."). I'm a designer, illustrator, and CSS developer.

I'm currently working with my friends at [&yet](https://andyet.com/ "A design and development group."), where I make cool web stuff for our team and clients (and occasionally [really cool swag](https://www.heroku.com/hanafuda "An article by Heroku about their custom deck of cards.")). I recently helped design and build [Wegotchu](https://wegotchu.cards/ "A site for creating and signing a card."), an app to pass around and sign digital greeting cards, and [Facecamp](https://face.camp/ "A site for creating animated GIFs to post in Slack."), an app to share animated gifs of yourself in Slack.

In my free time I make weird projects for the web. I do CSS illustration with just [a single div](https://a.singlediv.com/ "Lynn's CSS drawing project.") and experiment with CSS on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/lynnandtonic/ "Lynn's CodePen account."). I've created a handful of sites dedicated to extremely niche topics that I hope are fun to discover like: [the meaning behind three-letter airport codes](https://airportcod.es/ "Lynn's site for looking up airport codes."), [comprehensive stats for the cooking show Top Chef](https://topchefstats.com/ "Lynn's Top Chef stats website."), [reasons to live and work in Arizona](https://why.az/ "Lynn's website about Arizona.") (my home state), examining the [Hollywood age gap](https://hollywoodagegap.com/ "Lynn's website showing the age difference between love interests in movies.) between movie love interests, the design histories and specifications for the [flags of the U.S. states and territories](https://hollywoodagegap.com/ "Lynn's website about the design of US flags."), [all the food mentioned on The Good Place](https://thefoodplace.cafe/ "Lynn's website about the food in The Good Place."), and [every shirt that David Rose wears on Schitt's Creek](https://davidrose.style/ "Lynn's website showing every shirt David wears in Schitt's Creek."). 

I've also been [redesigning my portfolio each year](https://lynnandtonic.com/archive/ "Lynn's site archive.") for the last 13 years.

### What hardware do you use?

I've never been organized enough to maintain separate work and personal computers, so luckily the companies I've worked for have provided quality hardware (and haven't minded me using it for personal stuff).

Lately I've been working on a 13" [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro], where I do pretty much everything with the built-in keyboard and trackpad. I do have a 10-year-old [Thunderbolt monitor][thunderbolt-monitor] I use for testing and watching movies, but I like the focus a small laptop screen provides.

I use an [iPhone XS][iphone-xs] for mobile testing, scrolling [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lynnandtonic "Lynn's Twitter account."), and watching cookie decorating videos on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/lynnandtonic "Lynn's Instagram account."). I work at a StandDesk, sit in a Torsa Taskchair that I got second-hand from a local dev shop (thanks!), and sometimes use a small [Wacom Bamboo tablet][bamboo] and a [TI-83 Plus calculator][ti-83-plus].

### And what software?

For design I tend to stay in [Adobe Illustrator][illustrator], but sometimes jump into [Photoshop][] and [Sketch][] when needed. For coding, I use [Sublime Text][sublime-text] and mostly build my sites with [Pug][], [Stylus][], plus [Grunt][] or [Gulp][]. I'm a bit of a late adopter and tend not to switch tech until I'm forced to.

Other software I use to build stuff includes [Netlify][] for hosting, [GitHub][] for version control and collaboration, [SVGO][] and [TinyPNG][] for optimization, [Kap][] for screen recording, [GoatCounter][] for analytics, and [Chrome][] and [Firefox][] dev tools.

For communication, I use [Slack][] for work and community text chat, [Talky][] for video calls, [DropBox Paper][dropbox-paper] for writing, [Trello][] for task management, and regular old texts and phone calls for chatting with family. 

And I use [Spotify][] for all my Broadway soundtrack needs.

### What would be your dream setup?

I always imagine an office with floor to ceiling windows that look out onto a nice green garden (or the Arizona equivalent) with a huge table for working with friends (plus some fast wifi).

Other than that, I have been dreaming about jumping into an [iPad Pro][ipad-pro] and [Apple Pencil][pencil].
