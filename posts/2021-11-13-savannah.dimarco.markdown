### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Savannah DiMarco](https://www.instagram.com/savannahdimarco/ "Savannah's Instagram account."). If I am not kissing dogs or taking walks, I am a very cheesy business owner at [Sorella Collective](https://sorellacollective.com/ "Savannah's graze board company.") and a very new podcast host with my bff Quinn ([Testing Our Twenties](https://linktr.ee/testingourtwenties/ "Savannah and Quinn's podcast."))!

### What hardware do you use?

An M1 [iMac][] (24 inch, 16GB memory, 1TB storage).

[MXL 990][mxl-990] and [MXL 770][mxl-770] condenser mics with an [M-Audio M-Track][m-track]. When we have a guest, we add a [Shure SM58 microphone][sm58] and an [M-Audio M-Track Solo][m-track-solo]. 

A [Zoom h4][h4] and an iPhone in the field.

### And what software?

[Logic Pro][logic-pro] for editing and [BuzzSprout][] for uploading and hosting.

### What would be your dream setup?

My dream setup is [a backyard podcast studio](https://www.dezeen.com/2017/09/21/six-four-five-a-architect-garden-studio-toronto/ "A dezeen article about a backyard studio in Toronto."), 2x [Shure SM7B vocal microphones][sm7b], an AKA ProCast Podcast desk, a [Behringer Xenyx 16 input bus mixer][x1222usb], [Bowers and Wilkins PX7 noise cancelling headphones][px7], a 4K portable HD camera, cameraman, editor woman.
