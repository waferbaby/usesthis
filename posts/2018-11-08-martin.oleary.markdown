### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm Martin O'Leary! I live in Newcastle Upon Tyne, in the north-east of England, where I make [art on the internet](https://mewo2.com/ "Martin's website."), and I design exhibitions for [Life Science Centre](https://www.life.org.uk/ "An educational facility in the UK."). I used to be an academic, studying glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica, but I don't do that so much any more.

I have a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mewo2 "Martin's Twitter account."), a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/mewo2 "Martin's Patreon account."), and a [web shop](https://shop.mewo2.com/ "Martin's online store.").

### What hardware do you use?

I live and breathe through my 2017 13" [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] (the cheaper model without the Touch Bar). I've been using Macs since around 2005, and I don't think I could switch away. At work I have to use a Windows machine, and using it feels like trying to type while wearing oven gloves. I also have a 2011 [MacBook Air][macbook-air], which I use as a secondary machine for art installations, long-running tasks, etc, and a box of [Raspberry Pis][raspberry-pi] and miscellaneous [Arduinos][arduino].

My phone is an [iPhone 6][iphone-6], but the battery life has become abysmal so I'm looking to upgrade. I recently bought a second-hand [Samsung Galaxy A8][galaxy-a8] for an art piece, which is a really nice piece of hardware, but I'm too tied into the Apple ecosystem to switch to it full-time.

My "studio" is one side of our guest bedroom, where I've got an [IKEA NORDEN table][norden], which is sturdy and nice to look at, but not so nice that I feel bad about dropping a soldering iron on it. It's currently playing host to the beginnings of a homebrewed modular synthesizer, and an [EleksDraw pen plotter][eleksdraw]. The EleksDraw is a temperamental beast, and a testament to my willingness to spend time fixing things rather than spend money on something which actually works.

When I'm thinking, I produce a lot of "write-only" notes, usually on whatever scrap printer paper I have lying around. For more permanent notes, I carry around a lime green Leichtturm1917 A6 Pocket notebook for art notes and a black hardcover Moleskine Classic Pocket for work stuff, to-do lists, etc. I like [Uni-ball Signo Gel RT pens][signo-gel-rt], but I keep losing them. For actually producing artwork, I use [Sakura Pigma Micron pens][pigma-micron] on Daler-Rowney Smooth Cartridge paper.

I carry everything around in a blue [Osprey Quantum backpack][quantum], which I've had for nearly a decade. It's been everywhere with me, from fishing boats in East Greenland to fancy-pants art galleries. They don't make this design any more, and I'll be gutted when it eventually gives up.

Some other objects in my life that I'd recommend without hesitation: the [Nintendo Switch][switch.2], the [Le Creuset cast iron casserole][signature-cast-iron-round-casserole], my old Berghaus hiking boots.

### And what software?

I live in the terminal, using [tmux][] and [oh-my-zsh][] to make things slightly more friendly. I have [Vim][] reflexes burned into my fingers, but I actually do most of my text editing in [VS Code][visual-studio-code] these days.

[Python][] is my first-choice programming language for most things (the one major exception is that I do all my daily generative sketches in [Clojure][]). I use a lot of [Jupyter notebooks][jupyter], but I'm a terrible person, so they're all called something like "Untitled94.ipynb".

I go through phases of using note-taking and productivity apps, and phases of completely freestyling my garbage fire of a life. Right now I'm using [nvALT][] as a note-taking app (I'm typing this interview into it), which at least has the advantage that when I eventually give up on it, all my data will still be in easily accessible text files. My office calendar and email live in [Outlook][], and my home stuff in [Google Calendar][google-calendar] and [Gmail][] - I can't say I like either very much, but they do the job.

[Dropbox][], [1Password][], [Chrome][]: these feel more like basic infrastructure than "software" that I "use". I use [Keynote][] for presentations, and it's fine, I guess? I feel like there's a market for better presentation software. I use [Adobe Illustrator][illustrator] and [Photoshop][] for a lot of stuff, and they're both great, exactly what you want out of expensive commercial software.

On my phone, I pay far too much attention to [Twitter][] and [Slack][]. Recently I've been using [Mastodon][] a lot, but I haven't settled on a client I like, so I've been bouncing between [Amaroq][amaroq-ios], [Tootdon][tootdon-ios], [Toot!][toot-ios] and the web interface. The main drain on my battery life is probably [Marvel Puzzle Quest][marvel-puzzle-quest-ios], which is my block-matching zone-out game of choice.

### What would be your dream setup?

Infinite storage, both digital and physical. Someone who comes by once a week, and discreetly files away all my discarded projects, so they disappear from my sight, but I can find them again later. A nice big window with a view of a tree and the ocean. A cold breeze and a warm fire.

If you mean, like, actual computery stuff, then one of my colleagues has a [reMarkable tablet][remarkable] and I kind of want to steal it, but that would probably get me fired from my job.
