### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Dan Bruno](http://danbruno.net/ "Dan's website."), and I'm a video game designer. I currently work at the music game developer [Harmonix](http://www.harmonixmusic.com/ "A video game studio."), and I'm working on a side project game as well. I also play music and write.

### What hardware do you use?

I'm mostly an Apple guy. I have two computers, a new 5K [iMac][] and an old refurbished [MacBook Air][macbook-air]. I also have two iOS devices, a new [iPad Pro][ipad-pro] and an old [iPhone 6S][iphone-6s] (whose battery I just replaced - gonna put off buying a big phone as long as possible!).

That said, I also write by hand a lot. I tend to use [Pigma Micron][pigma-micron] pens and Field Notes notebooks. Most importantly I use Hobonichi Techos for journaling, which I've done every day for about three years now. If my apartment building was burning down and I could only get one armful of stuff out the door, I'd grab the Techos and leave everything else.

As for audio hardware, I have a [Scarlett 2i2][scarlett-2i2] USB audio interface, a few miscellaneous microphones, and a bunch of instruments: two guitars, two basses, a mandolin, and a digital piano.

### And what software?

I use the game engine [Unity][] for the aforementioned side project. (Though I'm still running an old version from 2015, because upgrading is expensive!) I do the [C#][c-sharp] work in [Visual Studio Code][visual-studio-code], although honestly I'm not a proficient enough programmer to have strong opinions about source code editors.

When messing with music, I use [Logic Pro X][logic-pro] for recording and [Sibelius][] for notation. (I'm also running an old version of Sibelius because upgrading is expensive.) For more general audio shenanigans, I sometimes use [Audacity][] or [Audio Hijack][audio-hijack].

I recently started blogging again. To support that, I use the static site generator [Hugo][] and the FTP client [Transmit][]. Relatedly, I've been getting back into reading RSS with [NetNewsWire][], which Brent Simmons recently reacquired. The current iteration is still early in development, but it does everything I need already.

I usually just do my writing in [Notes][] or [TextEdit][] (or Visual Studio Code, if I want [Markdown][]), but when I'm working on something longer I'll use [Scrivener][]. Most of my Scrivener writing to date has been for [National Novel Writing Month](https://nanowrimo.org/ "A movement encouraging people to write a novel in a month."), but I'm currently experimenting with using it as a game development tool as well.

I'm not a big film or television person, but I use [MakeMKV][] and [Handbrake][] to get digital versions of the physical media I do own and then store it all in [Plex][].

A grab bag of other things I see while rifling through my Applications folder: I use [Acorn][] for image editing, [Quicksilver][] for app launching, and [1Password][] for password managing. I use [Backblaze][] and [SuperDuper][] for backups. I'm not all-in on GTD quite yet, but I use [Things][] for to-do lists. I use [Versions][] for source control on my game.

As for iOS, I find that I can get pretty far with the stock apps. The third-party ones I use the most are the podcast player [Overcast][overcast-ios], the library ebook manager [Libby][libby-ios], and the iPad drawing app [Procreate][procreate-ios]. I recently stopped using [Twitter][] in favor of [Mastodon][] ([hello!](https://xoxo.zone/@danbruno "Dan's Mastodon account.")), but I was a big fan of [Tweetbot][tweetbot-ios] as well.

### What would be your dream setup?

I'm happy with what I've got, really. If money were no object, I'd probably just upgrade the things I already have - I could keep up with newer pro hardware, maybe, or buy up-to-date versions of software instead of clinging to old releases until they're deprecated. I need time and mental energy more than I need a better setup, I think!
