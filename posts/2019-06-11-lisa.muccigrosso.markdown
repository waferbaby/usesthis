### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm Lisa Muccigrosso and I'm currently one year through a two-year, full-time bookbinding program at [North Bennet Street School](https://www.nbss.edu/ "A university in Boston.") in Boston, Massachusetts. My undergraduate degree was in art and was where I was first introduced to bookbinding and letterpress printing. Through my work as a curatorial student assistant, I was introduced to art storage and handling, and was first exposed to the idea of art conservation as a career path. These experiences, combined with a lifelong fascination with books and ephemera, led me to study for my MLS and focus on archives and special collections. 

My graduate studies offered many opportunities; as a result, much of my early professional experience was in libraries, archives, and museums. I worked in the [Wisconsin Historical Society](https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/ "A library and archive in Wisconsin.") conservation lab, mostly on manuscript materials and photographs, with the odd scrapbook thrown in here and there. I served two years as Library Assistant at [UW-Madison Memorial Library's Special Collections](https://www.library.wisc.edu/specialcollections/ "A collection of rare books and manuscripts at the University of Wisconsin."), and also as an LTE cataloger in the same department working with Italian imprints from the 16th-19th centuries. I also served as Conservation Archivist for the [Wisconsin Veterans Museum Research Center](https://www.wisvetsmuseum.com/research/ "The research centre at the Veterans Museum in Wisconsin."), performing repair treatments on books, maps, and other paper materials.

As is often the case working in a MLS-saturated market, finding long-term work was challenging in the area in which I lived. To make ends meet, I transitioned to the software industry and spent seven years crushing it/working with rockstars/dogfooding/etc. It was a great experience, but over the past year, I decided that it was time to return to my roots. It was a big and scary leap away from something that had become comfortable in a place I had called home for most of my life, and I'm really glad I did it.

### What hardware do you use?

I use a Lenovo [Yoga 730][thinkpad-yoga-730] laptop and a Google [Pixel 2][pixel-2] phone. I use my phone far more than my laptop.

My tools, though - where do I begin? My apron pocket has a [bone folder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_folder "The Wikipedia entry for Bone Folder."), a small measuring tape, a mechanical pencil, and a Sharpie at all times. Every student gets a workbench. My bench holds various and sundry small hand tools, from needles, scissors, sandpaper, a variety of folding tools, and glue/paste brushes to steel key stock (useful as measuring jigs) to handmade leather paring knives (from our coursework with guest instructor [Jeff Peachey](https://jeffpeachey.com/ "Jeff Peachy's website.")) to a cobbler's hammer for [rounding and backing](https://centerforbookarts.org/monday-methods-rounding-and-backing/ "An aticle on how to round and back book spines.") book spines. I have glue pots, microspatulas, Olfa knives, and a cast-iron copy press - in fact, there's a press on each bench and more scattered throughout the bindery.

Around the bindery we have cast-iron board shears for cutting down paper, book cloth, and book board. There are job backers for rounding and backing, a total of four hot foil stamping machines: two Kwikprint [Model 86s][model-86], one [Model S-2][model-s-2], a Kensol K36, and the requisite brass type for use in the three smaller machines. We have two ploughs that can serve many uses, and a handful of razor blade leather paring machines (such as the [Felsted Skiver][felsted-skiver]). For hand-titling and hand-tooling, we have handle letters, myriad finishing tools, and finishing stoves. 

### And what software?

I use [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/resting_book_face/ "Lisa's Instagram account.") for a mix of light self-promotion and general tomfoolery. The [G Suite][g-suite] is my friend for email, photo storage, document generation and management, calendaring - you name it. I've registered a domain that I plan to stand up with [Squarespace][] once I have a suitable arsenal of quality images and a goal for what I want a website to do for me.

### What would be your dream setup?

I think I'm living it right now. I'm lucky to have access to the equipment that NBSS has. If I were to set up my own shop from scratch, I'd need many thousands of dollars to get my hands on the stuff I get to use every day. Besides, I still have a lot to learn - my dream setup may change by the time graduation day rolls around.
