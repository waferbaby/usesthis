### Who are you, and what do you do?

Hello everyone, [Davide](http://www.da5ide.com/ "Davide's website.") here. 

Computer Scientist (back when [evolutionary computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_computation "The Wikipedia entry for evolutionary computation.") was the next big thing and you still had to drive your own car), Interaction Designer (all hail fellow [Ivreans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_Design_Institute_Ivrea "The Wikipedia entry for the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea.")), part-time [Venture Capitalist](https://d4v.com/ "Davidfe's venture capital firm."), crypto-enthusiast (here's my [crypto Twitter list](https://twitter.com/da5ide/lists/crypto "Davide's crypto Twitter list.")), and currently Managing Director at [IDEO Tokyo](https://www.ideo.com/location/tokyo "The Tokyo office for IDEO."). I had been struggling with the question "what did you design lately" until [this perfect tweet](https://twitter.com/migreyes/status/973224290811342849 "Mig Reyes' tweet about design leadership.").

Grew up in Italy, spent about 10 years in the SF Bay Area and relocated to Tokyo in 2013. It's a beautiful, inspiring place and people can actually pronounce my name over here.

### What hardware do you use?

My hardware setup is pretty straightforward: 2 Laptops, 1 iPhone, 1 iPad, 1 Kindle.

I keep my two nearly identical 13" [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] (one old, one new) synced between home and work through [Dropbox][] and [Chrome][]: 100% of the content I need to access is cloud-synced. My laptops are always plugged into a 27" display (one [Apple][cinema-display] at home, one [LG][ultrafine-5k] at work) and I believe in [single-screen productivity](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/20/technology/personaltech/surviving-and-thriving-in-a-one-monitor-world.html "A New York Times article about productivity and multiple screens."), as long as your screen is big enough and you use a [window manager app][sizeup].

There's a lot of commuting, walking, cycling, socializing and drinking in Tokyo and I would hate to drop or lose my machine. So when I'm out and about I no longer carry anything beside my phone, and it's really refreshing to get home and pick up things from where you left them with zero effort.

Then there's my [iPhone][iphone-xs] (which I'd probably trade for a Pixel if my Japanese carrier allowed), an [iPad][ipad-pro] at home which is non-stop playing videos or podcasts and a reliable [Kindle Paperwhite][kindle-paperwhite] loaded with more books I could possibly read in my entire lifetime.

I've been a carry-on, single-bag traveller for many years and the [SDR D3][d3-traveller] is my bag of choice.

### And what software?

I'm constantly tweaking and improving my work and life-flow. 

[Caffeine][] keeps my machine awake and [Breaktime][] puts it to sleep (I typically work in 16-minute on / 4-minute off cycles for increased focus and productivity). Work is [Slack][], [Google Apps][g-suite], Dropbox. [Fantastical][] is my calendar of choice and [Things][] is for todos. [1Password][] keeps me sane (do yourself a favor and get on it). [Overcast][overcast-ios] (podcast player) and [Blinkist][] (book summaries) keep me smart. [Spotify][] (music) keeps me flowing.

I believe in a [transhumanistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism "The Wikipedia entry for transhumanism.") and [singularitarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularitarianism "The Wikipedia entry for singularitarianism.") future and I'm a compulsive note-taker: I have tens of thousands of unorganized notes collected in [Simplenote][] and use [Evernote][] for business cards and web clippings. I could talk about [Google Photos][google-photos] for days: it is as much of a photo app as a note app to me. After a dozen iterations, I now use color-coded post-it notes for all my handwritten notes, photograph and keep them in Google Photos for easy and instant access. You'd be surprised how convenient that is.

[Stoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism "The Wikipedia entry for stoicism.") is my life's OS.

### What would be your dream setup?

Beside longer battery life and wireless charging for everything, not much else I'd want right now. 

But I often wish for a more connected and integrated world: 

- A global telco carrier with a lifetime, flat-fee subscription.
- A biometrics-powered passport allowing me VISA-less access to all countries in the world.
- A fair, universal tax-scheme proportional to the number of days I spend in each country every year.
- A service-agnostic messaging app.
- And of course a single, government-independent and censorship-resistant global digital currency. 

It's 2019, people, let's get to work.
