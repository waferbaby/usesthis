### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Arvi Teikari](http://hempuli.com/ "Arvi's website."), an indie developer located in Helsinki, Finland. I've been making indie games for some 16-17 years now and I especially like small experimental games and game jams.

### What hardware do you use?

I use a 4-year-old laptop running Windows, apparently with around 8 GB of RAM. Looks like I have an Intel processor running at around 2.4 GHz with 4 CPU cores.

### And what software?

I use [Multimedia Fusion 2][multimedia-fusion] by Clickteam, augmented by [Lua][]. My other common development tools are [Aseprite][] & [Krita][] for visuals, [Notepad++][notepad-plusplus] for programming and [OpenMPT][] & [Audacity][] for audiowork. I like to use [freesound.org](https://freesound.org/ "A collection of free audio samples.") for sound files, along with the [Sonatina Symphonic Orchestra][sonatina-symphonic-orchestra] library for instrument sounds.

### What would be your dream setup?

An ergonomic & spacious desk with a slightly more powerful laptop with long-lasting batteries, preferably running [Windows 7][windows-7], semi-good-quality speakers with a subwoofer and a working mouse. As for computer hardware, I'm afraid that I have no idea what I'd be looking for since laptops aren't generally conducive to tinkering with their innards apart from cleaning and swapping the hard drive. An SSD would be nice to have.
