### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Jim Leonard](http://trixter.oldskool.org/ "Jim's website."), although I've been known as Trixter for nearly three decades in various circles, such as the [demoscene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene "The Wikipedia entry for demoscene."). I've played a part in many [vintage hardware](http://www.vintage-computer.com/vcforum/forum.php "The Vintage Computer forums.") and software preservation activities, such as co-founding [MobyGames](http://www.mobygames.com/ "A video game database."), consulting museums on how to archive electronic entertainment, and working with [private collectors](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/swcollect "A software collectors Google group.") on how to rescue and preserve the digitial bits in their collection. I bang on old hardware, both figuratively and literally.

When I'm not trying to save the history of the early days of IBM PC gaming, I code demoscene productions in assembler. I've shown how it's possible to play video on an old PC not [once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6CkYou6hYU "Jim's 8088 corruption video on YouTube.") but [twice](http://trixter.oldskool.org/2014/06/19/8088-domination-post-mortem-part-1/ "Jim's post about his 8088 Domination software."), and my most recent accomplishment is being part of a team that [won the "oldskool" competition at Europe's largest demoparty](http://trixter.oldskool.org/2015/04/07/8088-mph-we-break-all-your-emulators/ "Jim's post on winning the Revision Party demoscene competition.").

I've also been interested in desktop digital video production since the early 1990s, when [postage-stamp multimedia][video-for-windows] was considered state of the art. I perform a lot of videotape and [LaserDisc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaserDisc "The Wikipedia entry for LaserDisc.") rescue using a variety of [TBCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_base_correction "The Wikipedia entry for time base correction."), scan converters, and video processors.

A few years ago, I combined all these passions into [a video series documenting some of the demoscene's "greatest hits"](http://www.mindcandydvd.com/ "Jim's collection of greatest hits from the demoscene."), with commentary from the people who created them.

### What hardware do you use?

My daily driver is a custom-built Core i7-920 assembled in 2008, currently retrofitted with a GTX 970 to assist in video production. (And for playing games, naturally.) But the proper tools of my trade are vintage systems, such as the [Apple II][ii], [C64][commodore-64], Amiga, and of course the original [IBM PC][pc]. I have roughly 30 vintage systems that I rotate in and out of use as needed, with various methods of connecting them to the modern world to transfer bits back and forth. (And for playing games, naturally.)

### And what software?

Desktop runs [Windows 7][windows-7], because I roll a lot of my own video utilities using [AviSynth][]. I edit video using [Premiere Pro][premiere-pro], and OpenCL-assisted-[x264][] handles video encoding.

For programming my demoscene productions, I usually design and prototype in [DOSBox][], then copy to the real metal for testing and refinement. In that space, I've been using the same set of tools for over 25 years: [Turbo Pascal][turbo-pascal], [Turbo Assembler][turbo-assembler], [Turbo Debugger][turbo-debugger].. and whatever [WordStar][]-compatible editor that happens to be lying around on the hard drive.

### What would be your dream setup?

As someone who is on the leading edge of the trailing edge, every old computer I use is already my dream setup. But a better Windows machine (12 cores, SSD array) wouldn't hurt, nor would a 3-panel display.
