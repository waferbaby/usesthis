### Who are you, and what do you do?

I am the author of Supper Mario Broth, a blog focused on obscure information about Nintendo's Super Mario franchise that is segmented across several social networks, with different content on each; the [main site](http://www.suppermariobroth.com/ "Supper's website."), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MarioBrothBlog "Supper's Twitter account."), [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/suppermariobroth "Supper's Patreon account."), and the [side blog for particularly avid Mario enthusiasts](https://smallmariofindings.tumblr.com/ "Supper's Tumblr account."). Since 2013, I have published over 11,000 findings.

Outside of the Internet, I work in adult day care with Alzheimer's patients.

### What hardware do you use?

I use a pre-built PC by Medion, a German subsidiary of Lenovo, with an Intel [i3-4150 CPU][core-i3-4150] and Intel [HD Graphics 4400][hd-graphics-4400], and a Philips 243V 23.6-inch monitor. My keyboard, mouse, speakers and headset are by Hama, a German company specializing in budget PC peripherals. I own a Nintendo [Switch][switch.2] for capturing screenshots and footage of games on that system.

### And what software?

I use [Noesis][] and [Blender][] to view and edit 3D models. I use [Audacity][] to edit audio. For capturing screenshots, I use [Greenshot][]; for brief amounts of footage of the screen, I use [ScreenToGif][], and I edit the resulting .gif files in the now discontinued Ulead GIF Animator. To edit video files, I use [OpenShot][] and [Handbrake][] for encoded video, and [VirtualDub][] for uncompressed video. I write my articles in [OpenOffice][], which I also use to export PDFs. Most of my time is spend editing images; for manipulation of pixel art, I use MS Paint, for photos, I use [GIMP][], particularly for its excellent Perspective tool, and I do the layout and additional graphics in [Inkscape][]. I also use Inkscape to draw all the original artwork found across my sites. When I need to deal with obscure image formats or need to manipulate large numbers of images at a time, I use [IrfanView][] and [ImageMagick][]. For datamining, I use [Frhed][]. To emulate games released for older systems, I use the following emulators: [FCEUX][] and [Nestopia][] for [NES][], [Snes9x][] for [SNES][], [Visual Boy Advance][visual-boy-advance] for the [Game Boy][game-boy] series, [DeSmuME][] for the [Nintendo DS][nintendo-ds], [Project64][] and [Nemu64][] for the [Nintendo 64][n64], and [Dolphin][dolphin.2] for the [GameCube][] and [Wii][]. Unfortunately, my hardware cannot run [Citra][] or [Cemu][], but if it could, I would use those as well.

### What would be your dream setup?

Ideally, I could have every Nintendo console connected to a capture card so I could record footage on original hardware without having to rely on often inaccurate and slow emulation. Failing that, a computer that can run Citra and Cemu.
