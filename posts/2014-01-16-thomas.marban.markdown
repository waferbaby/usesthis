### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Thomas Marban](http://www.marban.com/ "Thomas' website.") ([@thomas](http://twitter.com/thomas/ "Thomas' Twitter account.")), founder of [tomatic](http://www.tomatic.com/ "Thomas' company site.") based out of Austria. I've been running digital businesses since the mid-ninties in various lineups.

I've created the original [popurls](http://popurls.com/ "An aggregator service.") aggregator, famously cloned by Guy Kawasaki and I was the co-founder of [Twidroyd][twidroid-android], the first Twitter client for Android. Both products have been acquired by [Idealab](http://idealab.com/ "The Idealab site.") in 2010. In between, I've also helped Kevin Kelly with the relaunch of CoolTools.  A couple of months ago I've launched [Postagon](http://www.postagon.com/ "A weblogging platform."), a commercial version of medium.com for novice bloggers.

I spend the rest of my time on running up to 60 miles a week.

### What hardware do you use?

In recent years, I've settled for a two-machine setup. That is, an [iMac][] maxed-out to get a lot of mileage out of it and a low-spec 11" [MacBook Air][macbook-air] that's being replaced on every new hardware release together with the usual iPhone and iPad combo. Other than that, I dislike gadget maintenance and ownership in general so I'm keeping just a very small collection of quality stuff. A [Sony RX1][cyber-shot-dsc-rx1] for photography, Bowers & Wilkins [P7][] & [MM-1][] audio gear, along with the very [first iPod][ipod-classic] from 2001 and a japanese [Game Boy Light][game-boy-light] with Tetris in permanent residence.

It took me many years but, I've successfully digitized all my music, movies and books which are stored on Drobos in redundant locations. If I weren't invested in them, I wouldn't purchase one today for reasons of their utterly slow performance. I don't own a TV, media center or other tech gear so the rest is literally just a box of chargers and cables. I like to travel very light but I'm a sucker for quality luggage that stands the test of time. Products by Rimowa, Filson, Porter and Killspencer are in heavy rotation during my trips. I don't sketch on paper so I just keep a small Midori Memo Pad around.

### And what software?

Contrary to popular stock-app bashing, I'm a zealot of anything that's built-in as for me, tight OS integration simply trumps everything. So other than [Lightroom][] & [Photoshop][] for photography and [Sketch][] for design, I'm only using Apple's productivity apps on Mac & iOS. I've tried each and every tool from [Evernote][] to [Things][] or Ember and [iA Writer][ia-writer] but turns out the file system is already pretty powerful if you're disciplined enough. Also, if there's a web-based version for applications such as [news readers][feedly], I'll always use that over a native equivalent --- even for [Gmail][].

For music, I only listen to my local [iTunes][] library since it's lossless and well organized. My own products are built in plain [Python][], running on [Google App Engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/)  so I'm perfectly fine with just any plain text editor du jour. I host my static stuff on [S3][] & [Cloudfront][]. I'm fortunate enough to work alone so I'm only on [Skype][] or any other IM for a scheduled call.

I consume tons of RSS feeds but even though I build stuff around it and other than the infrequent tweet, I don't really engage in social media. I do maintain a collection of vintage Porsches on [Pinterest](http://www.pinterest.com/thomas/vintage-porsche-911/ "Thomas' Porsche pins on Pinterest.") though.

### What would be your dream setup?

As soon as Macbooks ship with 2TB of Flash memory, I'll switch back to a one-machine setup, but other than that I don't really worry about hardware decisions as long as they get the job done - dream setups are just always two years away.
