### Who are you, and what do you do?

[I am](https://www.suryamattu.com/ "Surya's website.") an artist, engineer, and data journalist (in no particular order). Currently I work as an investigative data journalist at [The Markup](https://themarkup.org/ "A non-profit data-driven tech news site."). I look at the ways in which algorithmic systems perpetuate systemic biases and inequalities in society. Most of the work I do involves writing code or words, with the occasional new media project, I also teach occasionally.

### What hardware do you use?

My main machine is a [Lenovo ThinkPad X1][thinkpad-x1-carbon] running [Ubuntu][]. I transitioned to Linux when [MacBook Pros][macbook-pro] got the butterfly keyboards. For my phone I use an [iPhone XR][iphone-xr], though I still miss my [iPhone SE][iphone-se] which finally gave way last year. Considering switching to the new SE which was recently released. I have used [Raspberry Pi's][raspberry-pi] for projects in the past. I am also a software defined radio's enthusiast and own a [HackRF][], [Ubertooth][ubertooth-one] and pretty much anything else Michael Ossman and the folks at Great Scott Gadgets make.

### And what software?

I spend most of my time between [VS Code][visual-studio-code], [Google Docs][google-docs] (on [Firefox][]) and a Markdown editor.

I have just started using [Notable][] and am enjoying it so far. I use [kitty][] for my terminal with a [fish shell][fish]. I followed some of the steps in [this blog post](https://remysharp.com/2018/08/23/cli-improved "A weblog post about alternatives to command line tools.") a few years ago and it really improved my terminal experience. Especially the 'tldr' recommendation. 

### What would be your dream setup?

My current setup works pretty well for pretty much everything I need to use it for. The one dream addition would be a Linux-based PDF reader/editor that is as good as [Preview][] on [OS X][macos].
