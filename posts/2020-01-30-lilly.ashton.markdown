### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Lilly](https://lillyashton.blogspot.com/ "Lilly's website."). I'm an artist and I like to draw both big and small bunnies. I'm also what they call a "content creator", because much like rumour has it that God created the universe, I created several good tweets. Something about the term "creator" feels oddly biblical and absurd, but I guess it's sort of a way of saying "artist" but giving that this distinct "online" flavour. I wonder if at some point there'll be a shift towards some other terminology for that, maybe like how we use artist to mean a traditional art-maker but also a musical artist. The point is that I'm a poster online.

### What hardware do you use?

I just got a refurbished old Lenovo [ThinkPad X230][thinkpad-x230] because my current laptop is cracking in half and I needed something primarily to travel with so it's gotta be small for my frail body to carry around. I like how business laptops often have this sturdy, kinda chunky look to them. I'm a businesswoman now. No one may make eye contact with me.

I also use an original [iPad][] for my digital art and I draw with my finger because I'm simply too powerful for pens.

### And what software?

I use [Tayasui Sketches][tayasui-sketches-ios] on iPad to draw in, it's a delight and a treasure. I rely on the good old classic [MS Paint][paint] for most edits, and [GIMP][] for anything it can't do. I'm an open source respecter and appreciator, so a lot of the time I'll be using that sort of software and the super basic Windows options.

For video editing I use [Windows Movie Maker][windows-movie-maker] (and I will never stop), and then I transfer over to [Shotcut][] after an initial edit to do anything like cropping, colour grading, and adding images or overlays. The advantage of Movie Maker is that it's more lightweight and runs well on less powerful machines, so I like to do my major editing there. No low-spec laptop can silence me.

### What would be your dream setup?

I'm always really drawn to portability so I'm just thinking of one tiny yet supremely powerful laptop. Maybe a powerful GAMING laptop (for gaming). I love my little old iPad because it allows me to do a lot of art stuff anywhere I go, but I would really like to get a shiny new iPad. Artists talk a lot about [Procreate][procreate-ios] and I'd really love to try it, but my iPad is too old for that and like, most apps that actually exist now.

I'm thinking about getting a desktop at some point to do video editing with as well, maybe two monitors so I can just have a picture of my inspiration, Marge Simpson, up on one of them at all times, watching me.. guiding me..
