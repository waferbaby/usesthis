### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Rob Cantor](http://www.robcantor.com/ "Rob's website."). I'm a singer & songwriter from Michigan, currently residing in sunny Los Angeles. I write for hire, I play in a band called [Tally Hall](http://tallyhall.com/ "The Tally Hall website.") and I also release music on my own behalf. I try to make fun and interesting music videos, too. For example, [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kymSZpfykBM "Rob's 'All I Need Is You' video on YouTube.") and [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6PxMRUgmbA "Rob's 'Perfect' video on YouTube."). Oh -- and [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z4iWAnrMGU "Rob's 'Old Bike' video on YouTube.") too. 

### What hardware do you use?

I have a 27" [iMac][] (3.4 GHz, 24GB RAM) and an [Apogee Duet 2][duet-2] interface. My main microphone is a [Manley Reference Cardioid][reference-cardioid-microphone], and my monitor speakers are [KRK Rokit 8's][rokit-8]. As for guitars, I use a [Gibson Les Paul Standard][les-paul-standard] (classic ebony finish, if you must know!) and a [Gibson J-185 acoustic][j-185]. And nary a day goes by that I don't use my trusty little M-Audio KeyStudio MIDI controller to trigger some [Kontakt][] library.

### And what software?

I use [Logic Pro X][logic-pro], along with a bazillian different plug-ins and sample libraries. The aforementioned Kontakt sampler is in constant use when I'm working. For drums, I like the Native Instruments Abbey Road Drummer libraries, as well as their [DrumLab patch][drumlab]. There's a tambourine library by a cool little company called Tres Sonique that I use on just about every tune I write. I also have some great vintage drum machines samples that I go to often -- the Oberheim DMX sounds especially good. I love the sound of [OldBlackGrand][], a piano patch by Pleyel, and if I need something brighter, I go for [Piano in Blue][piano-in-blue] by Cinesamples. For orchestral stuff, I like Spitfire -- either Albion or Sable.

For soft-synths, my favorites are NI's [Massive][] or [U-he's Diva][diva]. As for plugins, my most valuable players are [SoundToys Decapitator][decapitator], [Waves CLA-76][cla-76], UAD's [Fairchild 670][fairchild-670], Lexicon's Verbs, and Logic's built-in delays. 

### What would be your dream setup?

Like most everyone, I would love more analog gear. Especially helpful would be a vintage mic pre-amp ([Neve 1073][1073-console-module], if you're looking for a great gift idea!) and an outboard compressor ([UA 1176][1176-peak-limiter], maybe). I could also use upgrade in the monitor department -- I'd love a nice pair of Adams.

And, heck, while we're dreaming... I'll take a bunch more great mics, a vibey upright piano, some analog synths, a vintage drumset, more fun outboard gear, a live room, a jacuzzi, and a tuxedo-clad butler named Helmsley, who I could send out for Taco Bell.
