#### Who are you, and what do you do?

[I'm](http://samanthagoldste.in/ "Samantha's website.") a software engineer and general tinkerer. I love making things with my hands, especially things that combine organic materials like clay and wood with micro-controllers and small chips. I like making things that are like me: soft, warm, and a little ridiculous.

#### What hardware do you use?

I use an [Epilog Fusion laser cutter][fusion-m2] for cutting wood and acrylic for jewelry making. I really adore this little [baby blue soldering iron][wesd51], and my [headphones][rp-htx7-a1] that match. I just got this amazing [mechanical keyboard][majestouch-2] and have some [pastel keycaps][paradise] on the way. I'm can't wait to get some time to watch a movie and swap in my new keycaps. My keyboard Cherry MX Blue switches which are extra clacky and have a really satisfying tactile bump. I love the way it feels to type -- every keystroke a resounding clack and every line a manifesto! I have a lot of handmade work and jewelry -- it's meaningful to me to know that time and care went into the tools around me, and I think it helps remind me of what I want to put into my own work.

I do, admittedly, have a bit of a zombie pit for hardware projects on pause. I once made a ceiling mounted light installation with an [Arduino Uno][arduino-uno] that responded to the audio levels in the room for a party. It was SO janky and potentially a bit dangerous, to be honest, but I was really on a _Halt and Catch Fire_ bender and I think the solder fumes were getting to my head.

When I'm not at home tinkering I ride my [bike][cortina] everywhere I can or I [make][ec155] espresso and wander around the city with my favorite to go [mug][keepcup-brew-cork].

#### And what software?

I have a terrible memory. When I switch panes the words from the previous page are completely lost to me in the transfer, so I use [Snappy][snappy.2] to stick things to my screen and [Spectacle][] to manage my window sizes with keybindings. [vim][] has given me a very dynamic way of thinking with my fingers, but left me with a taste for absolutely _never_ lifting my hands off of the keyboard that Spectacle helps to satisfy.

I use vim at work, mostly because when I learned in college I didn't know there were other alternatives and it made me feel very 1337. In fact, I used to SSH into every single vim window because I didn't realize that vim panes existed for _years_; it was a dark time. These days I use [tmux][] to persist my panes through SSH sessions. At home I use [Atom][] for editing (with vim keybindings). Having two editors helps me separate my work-programming from my home-programming and helps me context switch between the needs of an enormous mono-repo, and my pretty humble home project space. I've been using [Bear][] for note-taking and dramatically upping my ability to write [Markdown][] on the fly.

I have a couple custom key remaps that I use [Karabiner][] for. I consistently reached the wrong distance for the ESC key for vim, and the hand position of CTRL-B for tmux felt awful. To deal with that I [remapped caps lock](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/complex_modifications/#caps_lock "A guide for remapping keys with Karabiner.") to CTRL when used with other keys and to ESC when used alone. Long gone is my vim-based pinky strain!

#### What would be your dream setup?

I want a nice space with lots of natural light and a pottery studio nearby. I'd love a more sophisticated [espresso machine][bes870xl] and one of those cute peg boards to display and store all of my tools for pottery, jewelry making, and hardware. I love to have my tools visible but neat (like a wall-mounted knoll). I really need a way to hide my chords and cables. Who knows, maybe if my things are well organized it will rub off on the rest of my life.

I also have my eye on a number of artisan keycaps, like [this][rainbow-ice], [these][marble-style-artisan], and [these][gmk-mondrian]. I'd really like a more advanced [soldering station][968a-plus], one that will suck up solder fumes and desolder mechanism!

After seeing Claire Dane's [Met Gala dress](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2016/05/met-gala-2016-red-carpet "A Vanity Fair article about Claire Dane's glow-in-the-dark dress.") I'd love to get my hands on some fiber optic fabric and make something with it as well in order to make some more wearable electronics!
