### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Nicholas Fulcher](http://www.nickychulo.com/ "Nicholas' website."), aka NickyChulo, and I'm an Art Director at Atlantic Records. My job is to get a musician's album cover from thought dust to a well communicated final product. This entails designing the cover personally or hiring outside artistic talent to bring the vision to life.

### What hardware do you use?

My tools of choice are: an [iMac][], a [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro], an iPad on occasion, Princeton Umbria brushes, black gouache, mechanical pencils, a large Moleskin with graph paper, [EPSON Expression 10000 XL][expression-10000xl] scanner, Canon [AE-1][] film camera, and color-aid paper.

### And what software?

Adobe [Photoshop][], Adobe [Illustrator][], Adobe [InDesign][], Adobe [After Effects][after-effects], Adobe [Premiere][], Adobe [Capture][capture-ios], Adobe [Draw][illustrator-draw-ios] (iPad), and [Peptalk][peptalk-ios] to keep me inspired! In retrospect, I need to break out of all these Adobe products, haha!
 
### What would be your dream setup?

My dream setup would be everything I have now, but in a big big well lit studio!
