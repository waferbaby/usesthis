### Who are you, and what do you do?

I am [Douglas Crockford](https://www.crockford.com/ "Douglas' website."). I am famous for having discovered that [JavaScript][] has good parts. That was the first important discovery of the twenty-first century. I also discovered JSON, the world's best loved data interchange format.

I am a programmer and a writer. My most recent book is [_How JavaScript Works_](http://howjavascriptworks.com/ "Douglas' book about JavaScript."). I am currently working on four more books about security, mathematics, Charles K Bliss, and the Misty language. I do not know yet which will be done first.

### What hardware do you use?

My primary machine is a Dell 17 inch laptop. I also have an Asus NovaGo that I use when travelling, and for testing my ARM projects, such as the [DEC64](https://github.com/douglascrockford/DEC64 "Douglas' decimal floating point library.") library.

### And what software?

I do most of my text editing with [Sublime Text][sublime-text]. I like it because it is fast and it lets me turn off most of its annoying advanced features. I like simplicity.

I improve my JavaScript with [JSLint][]. I test my JavaScript on [Firefox][], [Chrome][], and [Edge][edge.2], in that order.

I use [Visual Studio][visual-studio] 19 to compile [C][] and assemble x64 and ARM64. Microsoft provides a lot of value for free.

I keep my projects on [OneDrive][]. I use [GitHub Desktop][github-desktop] to push [my public code](https://github.com/douglascrockford/ "Douglas' GitHub account.").

I use [Prince][] to make PDFs of my books.

I occasionally use these Adobe CS4 programs: [Dreamweaver][], [Photoshop][], [Acrobat][], [Illustrator][], and [Flash][]. I don't use any of them enough to justify a subscription to their latest cloud offerings.

### What would be your dream setup?

When I started programming, my university's computer had 16k of memory, filled a large room with a raised floor and fire suppression system, required constant maintenance, and cost millions of dollars.

I am happy with the hardware situation. I can easily carry both of my laptops in one hand. They are cheap and very reliable, and literally a million times better than the computer I shared at school.

Unfortunately, software is only about a hundred times better. We still have a long long way to go to make the software for the dream setup.
