### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is Catherine Mulbrandon and I'm a designer. Economic data is scattered over many websites like the IRS, the Census Bureau, the Congressional Budget Office and in academic journals. Over the years, I have taken this data and tried to make it accessible through clear, easy to understand data graphics which I post to my site, [Visualizing Economics](http://visualizingeconomics.com/ "Catherine's website.").

In 2009, I started consulting for clients who need my expertise creating static data-heavy graphics about financial/economic subjects or designing interactive dashboards for startups. In 2011, I used [Kickstarter][] to raise funds for my book, [An Illustrated Guide to Income in the United States](http://visualizingeconomics.com/book/ "Catherine's book."), which was published last year.

### What hardware do you use?

My digital home is a [2011 MacBook Pro][macbook-pro]. It's starting to slow down and I hope to replace it in the next year or two. At home, I connect it to my [23" Apple Cinema Display][cinema-display] set up on [Ikea IVAR][ivar] shelves, but a lot of my work is done at a co-working space in Hoboken, where I connect to whatever PC monitor is available. I can often be found at a standing desk - even at a cafe you'll find me at the counter, standing up. Too many years in bad office chairs have taken their toll. 

I have an [iPad 2][ipad-2] mostly for [Twitter][], online reading, or just wasting time, and an [iPhone 4][iphone-4] for my camera, my phone, my music player, my email checker, and my directions-giver when I'm away from my computer. There's a [Canon PIXMA MX330][pixma-mx330] and a laser printer at my co-working space if I need to print a design to review; I often catch mistakes or sketch new ideas when I review the design on paper.

My older white [Macbook][] from 2006 has been repurposed as my "entertainment center" for watching movies and TV online. I've attached it to a small flat-screen TV (Samsung) and 20-year-old Cambridge SoundWorks speakers along with 10-year old [AKG K 240 Studio headphones][k-240-studio]. 

I recently bought an eBags [eTech 2.0 Downloader Laptop backpack][etech-2.0-downloader] to be my portable office (my 20-year-old backpack is still around for everything else.)

### And what software?

My starting point for most visualizations is [MS Excel 2011][excel] for Mac, where I clean/reformat the data tables (I used to run [Parallels][parallels-desktop] on my Mac so I could have the Windows version of Excel, but it was slow and awkward and most software now has a Mac version). When I want to sketch out an idea I often copy the data into [OmniGraphSketcher][], which is now open source and very useful for simple data tables. If the data set is large or a more complex visualization is needed I can open [R][] or the new [Tableau][public] for Mac. After I get comfortable with the data, I sketch ideas with any pens and graphing paper I have available. My sketches are just for me, so I can get an idea out of my head quickly then back into the software again. 

[Illustrator][] is where I often end up for my design process. However, when creating my book, [InDesign][] was indispensable. The [MAPublisher][] plugin for Illustrator is how I create my maps, but my most important mapping tool is my brother (an urban geographer who runs [Design &amp; Geography](http://designandgeography.com/ "Matthew's design and map website.")). He uses a combination of open source mapping tools ([Python][] and the [GeoPandas][] library) to create the shape files and data files I need. I have a library of icons I bought from DutchIcon but will sometime jump on [The Noun Project][the-noun-project] if I need something quick.

[Squarespace][] for hosting my web site. I use to have a self-hosted [Wordpress][] site but I got tired of having to be my own site admin, and Squarespace is a simple and cheap alternative to hosting services that provide a lot of support for Wordpress blogs. 

[Preview][], which comes with [Mac OS X][macos], is good for my basic photo editor and making PNG files for the web. [Dropbox][] is my main document directory, so I always have access to my files on other devices or can easily share files. [TextMate][] for my basic writing needs, from long emails to simple coding. [Chrome][] is my preferred web browser on my laptop but these days I'm likely to be browsing the web on my iPad with [Safari][]. [Pandora][] for music on my iPhone and [Spotify][] for my laptop. I was never a big purchaser of music, but these days I can't remember the last time I paid for it. [Harvest][] for time tracking and invoices. [Fantastical][] displays my calendar on all my Apple devices but [Google Calendar][google-calendar] is the underlining service.

New additions to my software library include [Unibox][] (used with my [Gmail][] accounts, because it groups my email by person, not just by time), [Mailbox][] for my iPhone and iPad and finally [Evernote for Mac][evernote-mac]. This is the third time I've tried Evernote, and hopefully this time it will stick.

While I have many free apps on my iPhone and iPad, most go unused. What I'm using often: [Fantastical][fantastical-ios], [Tweetbot][tweetbot-ios], [Safari][safari-ios], [Downcast][downcast-ios] for podcasts, [Google Maps][google-maps-ios], and occasionally [Paper][paper-ios.2] for [Facebook][], and [Feedly][feedly-ios] for my RSS feeds. However, RSS has become less interesting to me the more I use Twitter.

### What would be your dream setup?

I want a laptop that's very lightweight but very fast, since I carry it everywhere and I normally connect to a monitor so it doesn't need a large screen. While I can code if I need to, I prefer to spend my time either looking at the numbers or looking at my design. I'm not happy when I'm debugging code or trying to figure out a workaround in a software package. What I want is a WYSIWYG editor where I can view and design a visualization while simultaneously edit its underlining logic in real time, but still take a peek at the data used in the graphic.

I can see just a hint of this future with high-end software like Tableau or open source projects (like [RAW][], built on top of [D3][d3.js]), but there's still a long way to go.
