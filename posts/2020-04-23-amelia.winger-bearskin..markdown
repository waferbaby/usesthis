### Who are you, and what do you do?

Hello, I'm [Amelia Winger-Bearskin](http://studioamelia.com/ "Amelia's website."), I'm a Developer Evangelist for [Contentful][]. I'm also Seneca-Cayuga Nation of Oklahoma Deer Clan (Native American.)

### What hardware do you use?

**Computers**

I use a [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] for work and an Alienware ([1080 GPU][geforce-gtx-1080]) for gaming and VR development (I have a T1 accelerator but I don't always use it). I use a Logitech [G613 mechanical keyboard][g613] and an AmazonBasics mouse.

**VR** 

I have 2 Oculus [Rifts][] + Touch that I use to prototype VR experiences, a Samsung [Gear VR][gear-vr], and a Ricoh [THETA V][theta-v] for 360 video capture.

**Audio**

An [AT2020USB+ cardioid condenser USB microphone][at2020usb-plus] for podcasting. Shure mic and Focusrite Scarlett for vocals (music.) Zoom Recorder for field recording (a large and a small one.)

I have a lot of keyboards (I'm an absolute keyboard nerd) but my two favorites I'm using right now are: Alesis [Micron][] with a vocoder and the Alesis [VI25 MIDI controller][vi25]. Mostly for making intro/outro songs for my podcast and some sound installations, one of which I showed at the For Freedoms Congress in Los Angeles where I made a 'low sensory' room for their conference where one could listen to 'un-guided' meditations I recorded which are sort of [funny versions of guided meditations](https://soundcloud.com/amelia-winger-bearskin/sets/unguided-meditations "Amelia's unguided meditations on Soundcloud."). I love that more and more conferences (like MozFest) are creating low sensory spaces for supporting neurodiversity and inclusion in their conference spaces - I wanted to do something like that for conferences who ask me to speak or give a workshop if they are open to it, and For Freedoms was certainly open to it!

### And what software?

**Websites**

JAMstack with [Gatsby][] + Contenful + [Netlify][].

**Podcasting**

I use [BuzzSprout][] to host [my podcast](http://wampum.codes/ "Amelia's podcast with native technologists.") RSS feed and connect it to [iTunes][]/[Spotify][] etc. Wampum.Codes is a podcast featuring native emerging technologists and storytellers - I published [a blog post](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/introducing-wampumcodes-podcast-about-tech-and-native-values/ "Amelia's Mozilla post about Wampum.Codes.") on it.

**Making Memes (and visual design)**

I use Adobe [Creative Cloud][creative-cloud] to do 3D prototyping and make memes and art stuff.

**VR**

[Unity][] to develop VR experiences and [Blender][], [Photoshop][] and [C4D][cinema-4d] for making assets. [My Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/studioamelia/ "Amelia's Instagram account.") has some of the raw images/screen grabs.

**Sound/Music**

[Ableton][live] and [GarageBand][] for audio editing. I record my podcasts on [Zoom][zoom.2] then edit in GarageBand.

**Productivity**

[Visual Studio Code][visual-studio-code] with [ZSH][] in [Terminal][] (with the Agnoster theme).

[My boss](https://www.stefanjudis.com/ "Stefan's website.") just showed me some cool things to use with [Alfred][] and [Chrome][] bookmarks which I think I'm going to start using.

[Slack][], Zoom, [Jira][], [Gmail][], [Houseparty][] and [Snap Camera][snap-camera] to make the most of virtual connections these days. So many Zoom calls, conferences, meetups and more since sheltering in place, I'm trying to keep it fun.

I founded the [Stupid Hackathon](http://www.stupidhackathon.com/ "A hackathon for building useless projects.") and I hope maybe to do an online version we can still play over Zoom - the one at Noisebridge had to be postponed but I'm very excited for when it happens in person again.

### What would be your dream setup?

I wish I had a professional recording studio, or at least sound proofing - construction across the street can be heard on my podcast, unfortunately. 

I also would love to have my own Oculus [Quest][] and [Magic Leap 1][magic-leap-1] - so far I've only been able to borrow them for testing and developing experiences on.

I also wish the Dell gaming tower I used to develop on wasn't broken; it didn't survive in my move from Brooklyn to Oakland last summer.
