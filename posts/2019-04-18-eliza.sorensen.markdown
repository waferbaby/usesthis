### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm Eliza Sorensen or [@zemmiph0bia](https://twitter.com/zemmiph0bia "Eliza's Twitter account.") everywhere else. I'm an Infrastructure & Security engineer based out of Melbourne, Australia and I'm a co-founder of [Assembly Four](https://assemblyfour.com/ "A sex worker and technologist collective.") who created the sex work friendly social space [Switter.at](https://switter.at/ "A sex worker-friendly Mastodon service (possibly NSFW).") and modern advertising platform [Tryst.link](https://tryst.link/ "An escorts advertising platform (possibly NSFW).").

### What hardware do you use?

It seems like these days I'm always on the move so I rely heavily on my Lenovo [X1 Carbon][thinkpad-x1-carbon], Google [Pixel 3 XL][pixel-3-xl], Audio Technica [ATH-AR5BT headphones][ath-ar5bt], powerpack, notebook and Lamy [Safari][safari-rollerball].

When I'm at my desk, I have access to two Dell 27" monitors, a [Ducky One][ducky-one] mechanical keyboard (cherry brown switches) and a Logitech [G700][wireless-gaming-mouse-g700] mouse.

### And what software?

I'm all about Linux on the desktop, my operating system is [Ubuntu][], my shell is [zsh][], I connect with [ProtonVPN][], I surf with [Firefox][], I keep my secrets in [1Password][], I listen to tunes through [Spotify][], I manage my time with [Toggl][] and tasks with [Clubhouse][], I write with [vim][], I code in [Sublime Text 3][sublime-text] and I keep my documentation close with [Zeal][]. 

### What would be your dream setup?

I'm pretty happy with my current setup but I wouldn't mind going back to a keyboard that has cherry blue switches.. but I don't want to drive my partner up the wall.
