### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Sam](http://www.sambuttrickart.com/ "Samantha's website."), and I'm [an illustrator](https://www.instagram.com/sambuttrickart/ "Samantha's Instagram account.") currently living in Portland, OR! I recently graduated from Pacific Northwest College of Art (PNCA) with a BFA and am currently navigating the freelance lifestyle. My illustration style is colorful and friendly, and I often include hand-lettered messages to accompany my shapely figures. I also enjoy designing my own products such as stickers, embroidered patches, and tees. I'm interested in a variety of projects: logos and branding, character design, licencing work, merchandise collections, and editorial illustrations!

### What hardware do you use?

My trusty hand and pencil! Most of my work starts off in my sketchbook and ends up on my tablet, which is an 11-inch [iPad Pro][ipad-pro].

### And what software?

I use [Procreate][procreate-ios], which I highly recommend! I find it super intuitive, user-friendly, and probably the easiest tool to use anywhere and everywhere.

### What would be your dream setup?

Nothing fancy, but I would love to have my own studio one day! I imagine this as a space where I have a digital setup and plenty of room for my traditional tools, as well as a storage area for all the products I sell on my [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/SaturndayArt "Samantha's Etsy store.") and website. And of course, having a space to entirely decorate with art (both my own and that of my friends and other artists I admire) is a dream, and sounds like a lovely place to pass the time.
