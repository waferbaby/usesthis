### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Alex Gaynor](https://alexgaynor.net/ "Alex's website."). I'm a software engineer, often with a focus on security. I currently work at [Alloy](https://alloy.us/ "A non-profit building political web tools."), which is a company building data infrastructure and tools for politics. I'm also very involved in open source. I'm a core developer of the [Python Cryptographic Authority](https://github.com/pyca/ "The PCA on GitHub.") and [CPython][python], I'm one of the authors of the [Hallow SSH Certificate Authority][hallow], I'm a member of the [Rust Secure Code Working Group](https://github.com/rust-secure-code/wg "The Rust secure code group on GitHub."), and I help fuzz projects like [ImageMagick][] and [GnuTLS][] via Google's [OSS-Fuzz][].

### What hardware do you use?

My primary laptop is a [Pixelbook][] with the maximum RAM/CPU. This is my primary development machine. My phone is a [Pixel 3a][pixel-3a] in grayscale mode. I don't do terribly much with my phone. I've also got an old [MacBook Air][macbook-air] which I mostly use for games, and a Nintendo [Switch][switch.2] which I use exclusively for games. I have a Fitbit [Inspire HR][inspire-hr] on my wrist, which orders me to get up and walk around. I've got a pair of Beyerdynamic [DT 770 Pro headphones][dt-770-pro], which are the most ridiculously comfortable pair of headphones I've ever had. Finally, I use a [Yubikey Neo][yubikey-neo] and a [Yubikey Nano][yubikey-nano] as my security keys, and I carry a large collection of other models with me to give away to folks who want/need a security key.

### And what software?

I do my development inside [Chrome OS's][chrome-os] [Crostini][], which is a VM with a container running a [Debian][] userspace inside of it. I love the security properties I get with this system, particularly that the Virtual Machine Monitor and emulated devices for Crostini are written in a memory safe programming language ([Rust][]).

I'm obviously using [Chrome][] as my web browser as a result. I always run with [HTTPS Everywhere][https-everywhere] (generally in "Block all http:// mode"), [Privacy Badger][privacy-badger], and [uBlock Origin][ublock-origin].

My primary text editor at the moment is [Sublime Text][sublime-text], but I change text editors semi-regularly (perhaps every other year), so I'm not overly attached. My shell is [fish][], which is a wonderfully usable tool to spend my days in. A look at my shell history tells me my other important tools are: [git][], which is my VCS of choice, [ripgrep][], which is an essential tool for quickly browsing and searching a codebase, and [vim][], which I occasionally use for lightweight code reading and even more occasional editing (as a friend of mine once observed, "Sometimes Alex accidentally opens vim").

My default messaging app is [Signal][], because I care quite a bit about security. And [1Password][] for managing my passwords because I care about security and usability.

### What would be your dream setup?

Beefier CPU and more RAM in my laptop. If I could get something closer to a top of the line [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] running Chrome OS, that'd make me very happy. I'd love it if Chrome OS had more tools for managing multiple VMs so I can maximize the isolation between different things I work on, bringing it closer to something like [Qubes OS][qubes-os], but without sacrificing usability very much.

But most of all, I'd really like it if I could get the Chrome OS security model without tying myself to Google.
