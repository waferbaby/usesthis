### Who are you, and what do you do?

Hi! I'm Tom MacWright. I maintain some open source software, like [a statistics library][simple-statistics] and [a presentation system][big]. I also write at [macwright.com](https://macwright.com/ "Tom's website."), publish [photos](https://macwright.com/photos/ "Tom's photos."), write [educational resources](https://mapschool.io/ "Tom's geographical information site."), do illustrations, and record music [solo](https://pueblo.bandcamp.com/ "Tom's Bandcamp page.") and with bands like [Teen Mom](http://teenmomdc.com/ "The Teen Mom website.").

Previously, I helped start a [mapping company][mapbox] and a [visualization company][observable].

### What hardware do you use?

I use - and this is embarrassing to admit - two nearly identical late-2019 [16" MacBook Pros][macbook-pro], one for work and other as my personal laptop. I put a sticker on one so I can tell them apart, but they're often stacked on my desk. It's much more power than I need for anything, though they were helpful when I was diving into the [Rust programming language][rust]. I also have a work pair of [Sony WH-1000XM3][wh-1000xm3] headphones sitting next to a personal pair of [Sony WH-1000XM2][wh-1000xm2]. The redundancy was less apparent when work and home were in different places.

During the day, I keep my laptop closed and plugged into a not-cheap-enough [Dell monitor, the P2415Q][p2415q], a [Keychron K2][k2.2], which I use only because its layout is almost identical to the built-in keyboard, and a [Logitech MX Anywhere 2S][mx-anywhere-2s], which - like the Keychron - can switch between the two computers with a little button. I'm a strong believer in using only one good display.

For illustrations, I draw with [Micron pens][pigma-micron], paint with Sakura watercolors, and scan everything in with a [CanoScan LiDE 120][canoscan-lide-120]. I also use a [Draft/Matic mechanical pencil][draft-matic] for sketching before inking, and the essential super Hi-polymer erasers for making that phase invisible.

I shoot [film photos](https://macwright.com/2020/07/07/windy.html "One of Tom's film photos.") with an 80s [Olympus XA-2][xa-2], which lives up to its reputation in every way, and digital photos with an [Olympus PEN-F][pen-f.2], which is perfect except for the battery life. Thankfully San Francisco has a [still-operating store that does film development](https://www.photoworkssf.com/ "A film development store in SF."). Most of the photos on the Pen-F use Panasonic lenses like their [LUMIX G 25mm][lumix-g-25mm-f1.7-asph], which are affordable and great.

In bands, I play a 90s [American Standard Telecaster][telecaster] and an 80s [Fender Bullet Bass Deluxe][bullet-bass]. At home, I spend more time with my banjo, an [Enoch Tradesman][tradesman] which I found secondhand, slightly customized by its previous owner. It will probably outlast me.

### And what software?

I do a lot of writing. Most of the code in [neovim][], and most of the English in [iA Writer][ia-writer]. Part of my brain has melded into vim, so I can't express an opinion on whether anyone should use it, but the plugins that folks like [Tim Pope](https://github.com/tpope/ "Tim's GitHub account.") and [Junegunn Choi](https://github.com/junegunn "Junegunn's GitHub account.") have been developing for the last decade are wonderful. neovim lives in [iTerm2][], which [George](https://www.patreon.com/gnachman "George's Patreon account.") has been steadily improving for a decade.

For photos, I switched to [Capture One][capture-one-pro] a few years ago and have never looked back: it's super organized and powerful. I always shoot camera RAW now because it can do such magic with processing. I use [Affinity Photo][affinity-photo] for additional processing, which doesn't feel as familiar or powerful as [Photoshop][], but I can't bring myself to pay the Adobe tax. [Figma][] does the job for quick vector graphics on the blog and prototyping at work. The process of publishing photos is a little complicated but the most important part is [VIPS][], which handles resizing and converting images.

I've tried a lot of digital audio workstations but always return to [GarageBand][]. If it's good enough for [St. Vincent](https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/features/apple-garageband-modern-music-784257/ "A Rolling Stone article about artists using GarageBand."), it's good enough for me.

Stitching the whole thing together, I couldn't live without [Alfred][] to quickly launch apps, [Fantastical][] to quickly schedule things, and [CardHop][] to make my address book a viable Facebook replacement, and [The Archive][the-archive] for keeping facts out of my head.

### What would be your dream setup?

My dream technology is e-ink. Right now it's slow, expensive, and mostly monochrome, but if there was a laptop with a paper-like screen - a [Kindle][] with a mechanical keyboard and neovim installed, I would switch in an instant. I want fewer things glowing.

I'd like ThinkPad hardware but running [macOS][], or a variant of Linux that really, truthfully, never requires one to tweak driver settings or read a forum. Oh, and for someone to invent a version of [Caffenol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffenol "The Wikipedia entry for Caffenol.") that works for color photos too.
