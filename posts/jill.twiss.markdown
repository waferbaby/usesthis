### Who are you, and what do you do?

Hi! I'm [Jill Twiss](https://www.jilltwiss.com/ "Jill's website."). I am a senior writer for [_Last Week Tonight With John Oliver_](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3XTzVzaHQEd30rQbuvCtTQ "The Last Week Tonight channel on YouTube."). I also wrote the picture books, [_A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo_](http://betterbundobook.com/ "Jill and Marlon Bundo's book.") and [_The Someone New_](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780062933744 "Jill's children's book.").

In my, ahem, free time I'm working on a musical about the women of the Seneca Falls Convention where American women first asked for the right to vote. I'm currently obsessed with a badass woman there named Martha Coffin Wright who showed up 41, pregnant, and "read a humor piece."

### What hardware do you use?

I don't know anything about computers. I have a darkish grey Mac laptop that I use at work and a lightish grey Mac laptop that I use at home. I got the Mac at home because I thought I was going to learn how to use [Garageband][] for a musical I'm writing. (I have not, in fact, learned how to use Garageband.)

I also have a desktop that I only use when I have to print something, and a printer that needs new ink after you print approximately seven pages. At work I have an adjustable standing desk that I use more than I thought I would.

Are couches hardware? I have a couch and a loveseat in my studio apartment. I sit on the couch when I'm just [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jilltwiss "Jill's Twitter account.") or doing fun stuff, and then move to the loveseat to say "NOW IS TIME TO SERIOUSLY DO WORK." Oddly, it's pretty effective.

I also have a [giant beanbag][yogibo-max], which is not good for working, but is very good for everything else.

_(Ahem. I just checked the laptop at home. It is a [MacBook Air][macbook-air].)_

### And what software?

At the office, we use a program called [Scripto][], which is specifically for writing late night shows. We also use [Slack][] to complain about everything to each other, because in truth comedy is mostly artful complaining.

I have an [iPhone SE][iphone-se], which I love so much because it has lots of memory but is also still bitsy enough that I can hold it in my hand, which is what I thought cell phones were for BUT APPARENTLY NOT ANYMORE. Two years ago I would have made a joke about Trump's hands here, but I choose to believe we are all past that now.

I got an Apple Watch as a gift and sometimes it reminds me to breathe, which... great? But truthfully I like that it counts more than just steps, and it includes my weightlifting time which is the only exercise I actually like.

I have bought maybe fifteen pairs of these Panasonic [in-ear headphones][rp-hje120] over the years. I have tiny ears and other earbuds won't fit in them. These do, so I buy and lose them repeatedly. Amazon changes the price a lot, but they range from like $6 to $10. I also have an [Alexa][], which I use mostly to ask it to play Jeopardy with me, and a shower speaker for, you know, shower-podcasts. Oh, and a [Kindle][kindle-paperwhite] because I love real books and Kindle books and ALL BOOKS IN EVERY FORM.

Other than that, I use [Google Docs][google-docs] for literally everything. I should not. I should actually learn [Final Draft][final-draft] or [Scrivener][] or whatever people write children's books on. But I do not. Google Docs till I die. They're the easiest way for me to have whatever random writing I want to work on at the ready no matter which computer I'm using.

### What would be your dream setup?

Truthfully, I used to just have a netbook that cost me like $150 and had no memory and I was equally happy. I probably wouldn't give up the shower speaker though. Or the two couches. Some day this two-couch theory is going to make me millions.
