### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Caitlin Rose Boyle](https://caitlinroseboyle.com/ "Caitlin's website."), and I am a cartoonist & storyboard artist currently based in Vancouver, BC. I write & draw comics like [FRANKIE & the BEASTLY BOG SONG](https://bookshop.org/p/books/frankie-and-the-beastly-bog-song-caitlin-rose-boyle/9e15d20a2a002251 "Caitlin's graphic novel, 'Frankie and the Beastly Bog Song.'") and [JONESY](https://bookshop.org/p/books/jonesy-complete-collection-sam-humphries/677bb6e0c426f180 "Caitlin's graphic novel, 'Jonesy.'"), and I work in animation on shows like Disney's [AMPHIBIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibia_(TV_series) "A cartoon about a girl transports to a world of talking amphibiabs.") and Nickelodeon's [RUGRATS reboot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugrats_(2021_TV_series) "A rebooted version of a cartoon about a group of small children."). I also co-created and co-directed a Nickelodeon short called [THE NIGHT CREW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwYYjvkzC9Q "Caitlin's animated short on YouTube.") in 2014. My work is very cartoony and fluid, and primarily digital.

### What do you use to get the job done?

When I'm drawing comics or working on an illustration, I draw on a [12" iPad Pro][ipad-pro] from 2018 - I like that it's portable, and does a decent job of replicating the feeling of drawing in a sketchbook. I added a Paperlike screen protector for a little bit of that toothy paper feeling, but I just use the standard [Apple Pencil][pencil] nib. For storyboarding, I work on a [2020 MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] hooked up to a large (21.5 inch) [Wacom Cintiq][cintiq] on an [Ergotron ergonomic arm][lx-desk-monitor-arm], with a small [Logitech Pebble Bluetooth mouse][pebble-mouse-2-m350s]. I also use a full mechanical keyboard for shortcuts; I tried to switch to a small hotkey keyboard at one point, but I never did get the hang of it.

For comics and my personal work, I draw in [Procreate][procreate-ios]. There's a little bit of a shortcut learning curve, but once you get it down it's very comfy to work in. If I need to format something for print, then I'll usually import it into the desktop version of [Clip Studio Paint][clip-studio-paint] - I moved away from Adobe a few years ago and never looked back! When I'm working on storyboards, I use [Toon Boom's Storyboard Pro][storyboard-pro], which is the current industry standard.

### What would be your dream setup?

Honestly I'm pretty happy with my setup! My one biggest gripe is how fast the iPad loses its battery charge - I feel like half the time I'm just getting into the groove of a drawing or a comic page when the 10% battery alert pops up. I can technically work plugged in, but the iPad gets really hot & it kinda defeats the purpose of working on a portable surface... in my wildest dreams, I have a drawing tablet with full Procreate functionality that lasts a full workday before I have to plug it in again.
