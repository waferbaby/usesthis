### What hardware do you use?

I use a maxed out [16-inch 2019 MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] as my main computer. When I'm at my desk, I dock it to two [LG UltraFine 5K displays][ultrafine-5k] with [Audioengine A2+ speakers][a2-plus], a large [Wacom Intuos Pro tablet][intuos-pro], a [Magic Trackpad][magic-trackpad], and [Magic Keyboard with Number Keypad][magic-keyboard-with-numeric-keypad] attached.

I use a [Sony Alpha 6400][a6400] as my webcam with a [Shure MV7 microphone][mv7] and 2 [Elgato Key Lights][key-light].

I've got an [iPhone 11 Pro][iphone-11-pro], [AirPods Pro][airpods-pro], and [Bose QuietComfort 35 II wireless headphones][quietcomfort-35-ii] always within reach.

### What would be your dream setup?

I think I have all of the hardware and software I'd want, so my dream setup to be desired is more about the space. I'd like a physical space that's comfortable for working and lounging, and looks cool. Probably lots of plants. I want all my books handy a few feet away in the room. I'd like to be able to play music when I want, or film a talking head video for [YouTube][] or [Instagram][].
