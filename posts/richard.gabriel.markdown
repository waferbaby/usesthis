### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Dick Gabriel](https://dreamsongs.com/ "Richard's website.") - I am a computer scientist, a researcher. I study or have studied artificial intelligence, programming languages, programming systems, object-oriented languages, parallel computing, open source, programming and programming methodology, and lessons for programming from other design-like activities, such as built-world architecture, writing, and art. 

My current research project is a natural language generation system called "[InkWell](https://dreamsongs.com/Files/InkWellTuring.pdf "Details about the InkWell project (PDF).")," which uses large languageÿ databases, optimization techniques, and some machine learned stuff to generate text and poems that sound like specified writers; my goal is to model how creative writers think, including working with connotation and the sounds & rhythms of language - its noise. InkWell is my research colleague.

I am frequently introduced at talks as "the world's most famous third-rate computer scientist." I've written [three computer-science related books](https://dreamsongs.com/Books.html "Richard's published books."). I program only in [Lisp][].

Hang on, that's not the whole picture..

Richard P. Gabriel / poet / fiction writer / essayist / photographer / guitar player / [poem a day since March 2000](https://dreamsongs.com/DailyPoems.html "Richard's daily poems.") / small book of poems / large book on writers' workshops / lead writers' workshops at software and patterns conferences / some poem collections have been finalists or runners-up for poetry prizes / some essays have won awards / write sentences real good / (some say). 

I collaborate with InkWell writing poetry / it like me writes poems by thinking about them deliberately, not by clever regurgitation / asked to write about "loud blues guitar music" InkWell wrote this haikuïsh poem:

      tuned adrenaline
    my music
      a beat-boogied headful

I blend these two Gabriels, and the result is an annoyance and puzzlement to most. In this boundary I work on the concept of beauty as a circumstance of complexity. 

I think, program, and write.

### What hardware do you use?

Mostly Macintoshes, not because Apple is great - but because Macs supply a nice UI to Unix. I have a 2013 [Mac Pro][mac-pro] (64gb ram, 8 cores, multi-terabytes of storage, 2 27" Apple LED [Cinema displays][cinema-display]) / because InkWell is only 70KLOC but 25GB running size. Several MacBooks (both [Air][macbook-air] and [Pro][macbook-pro]), a couple of [Mac Mini][mac-mini] servers for this and that, an [iMac][]. A 1962 re-issue [Stratocaster][], a 1970s Les Paul [Black Beauty][black-beauty], and 1970s [335][es-335], a Mesa [Boogie Mark IV][boogie-mark-iv], a Marshall head, an A100 Hammond (B3 equivalent) + Leslie speaker, Canon [5D3][eos-5d-mark-iii] and various lenses. Kensington [Expert trackball][expert-mouse] & Matias [Tactile Pro keyboard][tactile-pro] for all my machines. 

### And what software?

[LispWorks][] Common Lisp; a variety of [Emacs][]-like text editors; Adobe: [InDesign][], [Photoshop][], [Illustrator][], [Lightroom][], [Acrobat Pro][acrobat-pro]; [TeX][], [TeXShop][], [LaTex][]; [Keynote][]; [Google Docs][google-docs] for collaborative writing; [Skype][] and [Hangouts][google-hangouts] for meetings. I run my own mail and web servers. 

### What would be your dream setup?

For InkWell I can use all the cores and memory I can get: I've written my own machine learning code, and InkWell uses a metaheuristic parallel optimization algorithm I came up with, so 256 cores seems about right; 64 terabytes of RAM should be enough. The Lisp system must be able to exploit all the cores and available threads as well as the memory space.

A couple of good 8K monitors and an accurate color calibration setup. The big Canons DSLRs are good but hard on travel not specifically about photography, so a decent-res mirrorless - something by Leica because of the glass.

A vintage [Telecaster][] would be nice to have. I have a good tube amp for listening to music, but can always use more NOS tubes - some more (multiple of 2) Bendix 5992/6V6GTs would be great, but I think I got the last two on the planet.
