#### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Tyler Feder](https://www.tylerfeder.com/ "Tyler's website."), an illustrator and soon-to-be-author living and working in Chicago. I just finished illustrating Cristen Conger and Caroline Ervin's [Unladylike: A Field Guide to Smashing the Patriarchy and Claiming Your Space](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/558376/unladylike-by-cristen-conger-and-caroline-ervin-illustrated-by-tyler-feder/ "A book about smashing the patriarchy."), and now I'm working on my first solo book, a graphic memoir about losing my mom to cancer when I was a teenager. I also run an Etsy shop called [Roaring Softly](https://www.etsy.com/shop/roaringsoftly "Tyler's Etsy store.") where I sell prints of my artwork (and offer portrait commissions whenever I have a free moment).

#### What hardware do you use?

Right now, I do the majority of my illustrations with an [Apple Pencil][pencil] on my 10.5" [iPad Pro][ipad-pro] (which is rose gold because I will take any opportunity to add pink to my life). When I'm not illustrating digitally, I'm pretty low-maintenance and use whatever art supplies I can get my hands on ([Micron pen][pigma-micron] with cheap watercolor is my favorite combo). I prep my artwork for printing on my trusty 21.5" 2013 [iMac][] and print everything with a [Canon iX6820 printer][pixma-ix6820].

#### And what software?

I am an absolute convert to [Procreate][procreate-ios] on [iOS][]. It's the most intuitive digital art program I've used, and the process videos it automatically generates are so fascinating to watch! On my desktop, I occasionally use [Photoshop][] (reluctantly) and [Acorn][] (my preference) to edit illustrations.

#### What would be your dream setup?

I'd love to take everything from my current setup and plunk it into a larger dedicated studio space. I work out of my itty bitty studio apartment, and lately I've been drooling over 2 bedroom apartments on [Craigslist][]. A separate room just for art sounds like heaven!
