### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Edith](http://www.edithzimmerman.com/ "Edith's website."), and I'm an artist and writer. I send out a hand-drawn newsletter called [Drawing Links](https://drawinglinks.substack.com/ "Edith's newsletter."), with comics and stories from my life. (Here's a recent [sample](https://drawinglinks.substack.com/p/puppy-drawing "One of Edith's drawing newsletters.").) I also illustrate [The Small Bow](http://thesmallbow.com/ "Edith's newsletter about addiction and recovery."), a newsletter about recovery and addiction. And I post drawings and comics on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/edithzimmermans/ "Edith's Instagram account."), too!

In the past I ran the website The Hairpin, and I've written for The Cut, The New York Times Magazine, GQ, Apartment Therapy, and The Awl. 

My greatest hits online have probably been the blog post [Women Laughing Alone With Salad](https://www.thehairpin.com/2011/01/women-laughing-alone-with-salad/ "Edith's Hairpin post containing a collection of stock photos of women eating salads on their own."), which became a [meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/women-laughing-alone-with-salad "The Know Your Meme entry for Women Laughing Alone with Salad."), and a [GQ profile of Chris Evans](https://www.gq.com/story/chris-evans-gq-july-2011-cover-story "Edith's GQ profile of actor Chris Evans.") in which I got super drunk. Also a comic on Imgur about [menstrual cups](https://imgur.com/gallery/5rg73 "Edith's menstrul cup comic on Imgur.")!

### What hardware do you use?

I draw every morning using pen and pencil on paper. I use [Pigma Micron Pens][pigma-micron] (sizes 01 and 03), black [Faber-Castell Pitt Artist Markers][pitt-artist] (in Bold and Big Brush), and [Staedtler ergosoft colored pencils][ergosoft] (the 12-pack). For paper, I use Borden & Riley #234 Paris Paper for Pens, in a 9x12" pad. Afterward I scan in what I like and tweak it on my laptop. I have a [Canon CanoScan LiDE220 scanner][canoscan-lide-220] (I always boost the exposure to get the background white), and a 2017 [MacBook Air][macbook-air]. 

I can fit the whole set-up into my backpack pretty quickly, which is great because I like to be portable. The backpack is from [Patagonia][ultralight-black-hole], and I've been using it since 2015. It's excellent!

### And what software?

I tweak the comics on my MacBook in [Preview][], the application that comes with the computer. I keep thinking I'll eventually get [Photoshop][], but so far I've been able to do everything I need on Preview.  
### What would be your dream setup?

A wooden desk in a bright room with nice windows looking out onto something natural -- trees, sky, maybe a birdfeeder? There would be plenty of shelves and lots of empty space. It would be quiet, warmish, and close to a source of coffee. It would also be where I keep all my yarn (I love to knit), so maybe there wouldn't be so much empty space after all...
