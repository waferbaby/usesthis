### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Andy Weir](http://andyweirauthor.com/ "Andy's website."), and I'm an author.

### What hardware do you use?

I have an Intel NUC running an [i5-7260U][core-i5-7260u] CPU with 16GB of RAM.

### And what software?

The OS is [Windows 10 Pro][windows-10-pro]. I use [Word 2013][word] to do my writing.

### What would be your dream setup?

Pretty much this. I'm not into video games so I don't need much power. The most processor-intensive thing I do is [Photoshop][] from time to time. I like using the NUC because I often have to take long business trips of up to two weeks. Rather than rely on my laptop, which doesn't have all my stuff installed, I like to bring my NUC with me in my carry-on luggage. Then I buy a small monitor wherever I'm going.
