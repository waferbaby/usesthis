### Who are you, and what do you do?

[I'm](http://ejohn.org/ "John's website.") a [JavaScript][] programmer. I work for [Khan Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org/ "An open education source."), developing a next generation educational platform. I'm the creator and lead developer of the [jQuery][] JavaScript library and the author of two books on JavaScript: Pro JavaScript Techniques and Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja.

### What hardware do you use?

Primary work computer: 27" [iMac][] (i7 processor, 8GB RAM) with 22" secondary monitor, primary laptop is a 13" [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] (Core 2 Duo, 4 GB RAM). I have a 60Mb/s cable Internet connection through RCN. I have a number of backup machines, mostly used for testing, including a PC running [Windows XP][windows-xp], a [Chromebook][], and a [MacBook][]. I also utilize a large number of phones and tablets for testing, most of which are located at Filament Group, the folks who are behind jQuery Mobile.

I also have multiple [Mac Minis][mac-mini] that I use for watching media. One is hooked to a projector that is capable of displaying 720p video ([BenQ W500][w500]), another is hooked to a 19" LCD that is in front of my elliptical.

I use an [iPhone 4][iphone-4] for my phone and recently acquired an [iPad 2][ipad-2] for testing, courtesy of Khan Academy.

In my kitchen I have an iPod/iPhone dock and speakers that I can hook my iPhone into to play music while I cook. I have a similar dock in my car.

I have a 5 Bay RAID-5 NAS ([Thecus N5200BR][n5200]) with 5 1TB drives in it (giving me about 3.6 TB of storage, which is currently all used). I backup all my media to this device and keep a spare hot swap drive in case of hard drive failure. I keep an extra backup of all my documents on [Dropbox][].

### And what software?

For everyday computer use I use [Firefox][] for browsing (holding [Google Mail][gmail] and [Calendar][google-calendar] in app tabs). I do a lot of writing in [Google Docs][google-docs], my presentations in [Keynote][], and my blog post authoring in [Textmate][]. I use [Skype][], Google Chat (inside GMail), and IRC (using [IRSSI][] in a screen session) for communication and [Gyazo][] for screenshot sharing.

For development I use [Chrome][], [vim][] ([vim config](https://gist.github.com/955547 "John's vim config.")), Textmate, and [iTerm2][]. I keep a number of browsers open at all times, multiple versions of Firefox, Chrome, [Opera][], and [Safari][]. I run [VMWare Fusion][vmware-fusion] with even more browsers inside (including multiple versions of [IE][internet-explorer], Firefox, Opera, Chrome, and Safari). I use [MAMP][] to easily run a simple, local, web server and [MySQL DB][mysql] to help with testing. I store all my code in [Git][] (on [Github][], oftentimes in private repos) and back it up in [Dropbox][].

On my phone I have the following apps on my home screen, from top left to bottom right: iPod, Clock, Notes, Camera, Settings, NOAA (opens weather.gov), Calendar, [Twitter][twitter-ios], [Foursquare][foursquare-ios], [Carcassonne][carcassonne-ios], [MassTransit][masstransit-ios] (gives me Boston bus GPS positions), [Yelp][yelp-ios], [Facebook][facebook-ios], and [iSSH][issh-ios] (can SSH into servers, use IRC), Maps, Safari, Messages, and Phone.

I use [VLC][] and [Boxee][] for playing all of my videos and [iTunes][] for playing my audio (synced to Last.fm). I use AirVideo to stream movies to my iPhone and iPad.

For acquiring media I use iTunes, Amazon MP3, [Netflix][] streaming, and Usenet. Specifically for Usenet I use [SABnzbd+][sabnzbd-plus], running on one of my Mac Minis, connecting to Giganews, and pulling from NZBs.org or Newzbin.

For games I play [Starcraft 2][starcraft-2] (id: frowny.396, I'm a Silver Protoss), [Minecraft][], and some iPhone games (including Carcassonne and [Words with Friends][words-with-friends-ios]). Word of warning: I'm currently ranked around 50th worldwide at Carcassonne, my ID is my email address: jeresig at gmail dot com.

### What would be your dream setup?

I'm very close to it now, although I do have a couple wishes. I wish my MacBook had built-in 3G capabilities, I wish it was easier to type on my iPad, I wish Chrome was a better browser, I wish SABnzbd+ was smart enough to not re-download files, I wish my iPhone was faster, I wish I didn't need a dongle to do a presentation with my MacBook, I wish Boxee didn't crash so much, I wish my car accepted audio input, I wish Dropbox could backup my Google Docs and Mail.
