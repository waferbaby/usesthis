### Who are you, and what do you do?

[Rob](http://cmdrtaco.net/ "Rob's website."). [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/ "News for nerds."). Brief Enough?

### What hardware do you use?

I'm currently using a 17" 2.3 ghz Core i7 [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] laptop for pretty much all of my computational needs.

I have a [Drobo][] plugged into an ancient Macbook in my basement with 2 TB on it. I also put a lot of miles on my [iPhone 4][iphone-4], my [PS3][], my [XBox 360][xbox-360], a [Xoom][], a Samsung S1, and my glorious [Canon 5D Mark II][eos-5d-mark-ii]. At my office I have a big 'ole [Apple screen][cinema-display] that I plug into. Sadly I'm using a 10-15 year old Microsoft mouse. Works great. I like it. But it looks pretty tacky next to an Apple [keyboard][] and screen.

I also have a [PodPro][pod-pro] on my desk and a red [Gibson SG][sg-standard] on the wall, but I usually wear headphones because I am a conscientious person, and I fear that people on the other sides of my office walls have firearms if I cycled through all 3 power chords a couple times per day.

### And what software?

Truthfully almost everything I do lives inside of [Chrome][]. Webapps for mail, news, spreadsheets, doc writing, bug tracking, reporting, and the entire Slashdot administrative UI. etc. My work is all in a web page.

I create [Fluid][] installs for each of my major web applications ([Mail][gmail], [Google Reader][google-reader], Slashdot, [Google Docs][google-docs], we use [Jira][] for bug tracking internally, etc). I've used a number of different chat clients - I find myself increasingly using the built-in chat and Facebook chats. The only thing that taxes this beast of a machine is the occasional video game, but besides playing the [Warcraft][wow] auction house, I don't have much time for games these days. I use [Aperture][] for organizing my photo library. I have an [Apple TV][apple-tv] that basically is used by my kids to watch Cars or Toy Story 3 whenever Mommy and Daddy need 30 seconds to boil water. Sometimes I rip a DVD. This thing transcodes videos at 3-4x the actual frame rates, although it sure does get the fans spinning up. I wouldn't recommend leaving it directly on your lap.

### What would be your dream setup?

I'd really like another monitor and a VESA mount so I could suspend a second screen without eating up my desk space. Then I could keep stuff that I casually monitor throughout the day visible, but without losing screen real-estate for the core of my day, which is generally spent writing documents, emails, and of course reading stories.

I also want a Marshall Stack and a 12 string Rickenbacker but noise restrictions apply. I wouldn't mind a really big telephoto lens like a Canon [EF 600mm f/4.0 IS II][ef-600mm-f4l-is-usm] or a Canon [EF 400mm f/2.8 IS II][ef-400mm-f2.8l-is-ii-usm]. Then I could take pictures of nature and children without having to run around after them. I'm more of a hard core "sitting down" kind of person. I could also use more TBs in the RAID array: The 2TB that I have now is enough for now, but in 2011, it seems like 10TB is actually fairly inexpensive these days.
