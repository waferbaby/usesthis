### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is Paul Khuong and I'm a principal engineer at [Backtrace.io][backtrace], and an occasional blogger at [pvk.ca](http://pvk.ca/ "Paul's website."). I work and blog from home, with my girlfriend and our daughter.

### What hardware do you use?

After keyboard-gate, I stopped using Macs. My main computers are now two Chromebooks: a 2018 [Pixelbook][pixelbook] for personal stuff, and a [Pixelbook Go][pixelbook-go] for work. I find [Crostini][] is more than sufficient to run [emacs][] (and [Steam][], even!), plus wifi always works (: For serious work, I plug the Chromebooks into a 38" Dell [UltraSharp][u3818dw], and type on a Kinesis [Advantage2][]; that's the price of middle age.

I also go through a lot of paper. I always have a couple Triplus Fineliner pens on me, and usually a plain Moleskine notebook: they're easy to replace, and I find the combination gives me just the right level of friction. I used to scan my doodles with a Doxie [Flip][flip], but I can never find the thing anymore, so I've been playing with various phone apps to rectify pictures (the current contender is MS [Office Lens][office-lens]).

Finally, I rely on two baremetal machines for my computational experiments. My go-to machine is still the 4-way [E5-4617][xeon-e5-4617] I built in 2013 for my PhD work. When I'd rather have a lot of slow cores, I turn to a desktop Xeon Phi. Its watercooling system is so quiet, I may just have to stick to watercooled towers in the future.

### And what software?

On Chromebooks, I use [Chrome][] and [G Suite][g-suite], a lot :) Otherwise, I live in graphical mode emacs ([Wayland][]) on Crostini. Over the years, my dot emacs has gotten simpler: I change the default font, enable some Solarized light theme, start emacsserver, load [ParEdit][], [SLIME][] (however [Quicklisp][] sets it up), and [Magit][]... and that's it! Depending on my needs and the lunar phase, I'll switch to Calc mode, [SBCL][] + SLIME, or [IPython][] for quick computations.

When navigating code at work, I find [Sourcetrail][] works well on our reasonably sized [C][] and [C++][c-plusplus] applications.

My blog is a clumsily hacked up version of [Octopress][] + Koenigspress, recently rebased on top of [Jekyll][] 4.x. I'm pretty sure it only works by accident, but also don't really have time to spend on maintenance, so I should probably freeze whatever mess I currently have in a container.

Chat has been [irssi][] and [SILC][] for more than 15 years, except that I have to use Slack's web client since they shut down the IRC gateway.

### What would be your dream setup?

When I close my eyes to visualise complex issues, I tend to move things between 5-6 zones in my field of view. I don't think it would be practical to replicate that workflow with multiple monitors. However, I hope that light VR headsets will eventually support a high enough resolution for text-oriented work; having the focus follow my eyes across independent virtual desktops certainly *sounds* like a good fit :)

I'm still looking for a good alternative to C and (inline) assembly... I'm told [Rust][] might be it, but I haven't found a good excuse to try it out; in the meantime, I just invest in more and more test- and compile- time tools.

Finally, I have yet to find a reference manager I can really operate. I'll usually remember useful tidbits of information as I work on a problem, but no useful search term to pinpoint a reference: I'm more likely to roughly remember where or when I read the relevant paragraph than anything else. One of my long term projects is an application that records everything I read or watch on my personal devices, and lets me query that list by approximate geolocation and time.
