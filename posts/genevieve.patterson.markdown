### Who are you, and what do you do?

[I'm](https://genp.github.io/ "Geneviève's website.") the Head of Applied Research at [VSCO][]. I take recent (or sometimes old) academic research and adapt it for user-facing features in the VSCO app. We have a small team and grad interns. Sometimes I work with outside researchers and PhD students too!

### What hardware do you use?

I have a [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] myself, but except for the simplest inference-time tasks I'm using [Google Collab Pro][collab-pro] notebooks and p2.xlarge and p2.8xlarge [EC2][] instances. I had a half dozen [1080][geforce-gtx-1080] and [1080 Ti][geforce-gtx-1080-ti] GPUs in a couple workhorse machines when I worked in a physical office. That became too complicated at the beginning of last year. Using cloud GPUs is easier for user data in S3.

### And what software?

I'm an [emacs][] person and am using [TabNine][] for autocomplete. Someone near and dear to me loves [Magit][], so I might get into that soon 😅

I'm mostly setting up my models in [PyTorch][], but I don't know if that matters so much anymore. I think it's more convenient for warping pretrained models into some strange shape that I need for output or mobile device constraints.

For network debugging I like [Postman][]. 

For [iOS][] development I use [XCode][], although I can't say there's any love lost there. 

Probably the oddest thing about my setup is that I like to rotate my terminal prompt randomly. I use [oh my zsh][oh-my-zsh], and set up my .zshrc to pick a prompt from my list of favorites at random. It's a nice surprise every time I open a new prompt.

### What would be your dream setup?

I sort of hate desks. Especially the same desk everyday. I wish I had a "random" function that would give me a different place to work every morning from my list of favorites. I used to like working from a hammock chair at my old MSR office with a view of the Charles River, but after a couple days I wanted that to be randomized too! I want to have a different visual perspective all the time. I think that's important to get my creative brain working.
