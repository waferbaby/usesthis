### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Michael Betancourt](https://betanalpha.github.io/ "Michael's website."). I am an applied statistician who develops statistical methodologies, computational tools, and [pedagogical](https://betanalpha.github.io/writing/ "Michael's writing.") [resources](https://betanalpha.github.io/speaking/ "Michael's talks.") that bridge statistical theory and practice. My ultimate goal is to provide better tools for practicing scientists of all fields.

I am also one of many software developers of [Stan][stan.2], an open-source platform for statistical modeling and computation.

### What hardware do you use?

I'm not exactly an early adopter. All of my work is done on a late 2013 15-inch [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro], with an awkward British keyboard and a dying battery, that I'm not planning on giving up anytime soon.

### And what software?

For writing code and teaching materials I make heavy use of [Atom][], keeping everything organized with [GitHub][]. When developing algorithms I stick to [C++][c-plusplus] and the [OS X][macos] [Terminal][], but when working on pedagogical exercises I use [RStudio][] for [R][] and [Hydrogen][] within Atom for [Python][]. As a consultant you have to be multilingual in R and Python to jump between different clients' environments, but when running my own analyses I largely stick to the command line with [sed][], [grep][], and [awk][] directing most of my workflow.

I spend perhaps too much of my time making figures to elucidate subtle mathematical concepts. For pure conceptual figures I rely heavily on the power of [TikZ][pgf] and for anything involving data I reach for the awesome [Gnuplot][]. When I need a bit more flexibility, or want to spin off another variant of the Stan logo, I'll use [Inkscape][].

When writing presentations I love [Keynote][], with [LaTeXiT][] providing equation typesetting support. For presenting I use my reliable [iPhone 6][iphone-6] as a remote through the criminally underused [Keynote iOS][keynote-ios] app.

My papers are writing in [LaTeX][] through the [MacTeX][] distribution. For my pedagogical writing, however, I have recently been experimenting with literate programming, mostly through [knitr][] although I am always on the look out for new developments in that direction.

### What would be your dream setup?

Given how much one can accomplish with a decent laptop and open source tools I haven't wanted for much beyond my current set up. Really the only thing I'm missing is an [eduroam][] account for which I've pined since leaving academia.
