### Who are you, and what do you do?

This is a tough question! Most of my life circles around writing all kinds of things, mostly non-fiction and fiction prose and computer programs. To me programming is art rather than craft. So is science, because there seems to be an obvious correlation between correctness and beauty.

I have self-published some [books](http://t3x.org/ "Nils' books.") about a variety of subjects, ranging from computer science to statistics, Buddhism and meditation. Then there have been two short excursions to the realm of science fiction. I have also designed and built a lot of [science fiction models](http://t3x.org/sf/ "Nils' sci-fi models.").

It is hard to be interested in so many things, because most people want you to be the X-guy, whatever X is, and this is not how I work. Today I might be interested in lambda calculus and tomorrow in entomology or poetry or whatever comes my way. I like to really dive into stuff and become completely absorbed in it. Sometimes I go from zero to "I'll write a book about it" within a few months.

### What hardware do you use?

My rooms are full of white boards. A good whiteboard marker is an essential tool. My preferred brand is the Pilot [V Board Master][v-board-master]. Then there are lots of other writing tools, from a Pelikan [M200 piston filler fountain pen][m200] to an old Wanderer Continental mechanical typewriter to the usual computer gear. I mostly start new endeavors on a sheet of paper or a whiteboard and then migrate to the computer as things begin to take shape.

I really like ThinkPads, but for some reason my current workplace machine is a Dell [Latitude E6410 notebook computer][latitude-e6410]. Most probably got it cheap from a used parts dealer. It is underclocked to 750MHz, because that is all I need. Honestly, I could do 99% of my work on a 16MHz [286](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80286 "The Wikipedia entry for the 286 CPU.") box without any significant loss of productivity.

Just to prove the point, I sometimes write texts and programs on my Amstrad [NC100][] notepad computer. That is a 4MHz Z80-based CP/M machine with 64KB of RAM, and it really feels quite snappy.

The Dell is connected to a 24-inch monitor in upright configuration for reading PDFs and a Cherry [G80-3000][] linear (black MX) keyboard, which I think is one of the best keyboards ever built.

Are books hardware? I have owned thousands of them in my life, I have read all of them, and they are the foundation of all of my endeavors. I often sell or give away old books, but they still keep accumulating somehow.

### And what software?

My current operating system is [FreeBSD][] 10.1 (which is six years old at this point and has never been updated), but I might return to [OpenBSD][] now that it has good support for low-power states on notebook computers.

My window manager is a patched version of [dwm][] that uses floating layout exclusively instead of tiling. I have one monochrome 80x24 [xterm][] window per workspace as well as one workspace for GV ([Ghostscript][]), and one for some old version of [Firefox][] with [JavaScript][] disabled. I read mail using [mutt][] and Usenet News with [tin][]. All versions are very old, I update software basically when the hardware dies.

For writing prose and programs I use BSD's vi ([nvi][]). I write software in [T3X][], [C89][c], [Klong][], and [various][s9fes] [dialects][lisp9] [of][kilo-lisp] [LISP][]. The usual Unix tools are indispensable for gluing things together. Most important to me are the [Korn shell][kornshell] (pdksh), [awk][], [sed][], and [make][].

Klong also doubles as a nice [scientific calculator](http://t3x.org/klong-stat/ "Nils' introduction to Klong's statistics module.") for the command line that I use for all kinds of quick calculations. I use a lot of software that I have written myself, because I am only happy when I understand exactly how things work.

### What would be your dream setup?

What I have. I could not imagine anything that would improve my work flow much. Maybe a slightly larger monitor for PDF reading at some point.
