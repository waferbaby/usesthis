### Who are you, and what do you do?

I am a core developer on OpenStack for Rackspace, coding the next big foundations for infrastructure and platform-as-a-service. I was a partner at a small company, Anso Labs, that got acquired by Rackspace in February of this year. Prior to that I've done interesting things at Google, Jaiku and Flock. I write at [http://term.ie](http://term.ie "Andy's website.").

### What hardware do you use?

My main machine right now is last year's 15" i7 [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] with the high res screen, though within a week or so I should receive the latest top-of-the-line model this time with a big screaming SSD, which really helps when you need to start up virtual machines within virtual machines on your real machine all day.

While at home I plug that into a [Belkin KVM switch][switch2] that is hooked up to a rather old 24" Apple [Cinema Display][cinema-display] that has travelled with me quite some way. My keyboard is a [Das Keyboard Model S Ultimate][model-s-ultimate] since it just looks so good and the mechanical switches really feel great. My mouse is a new [Logitech MX518][mx-518] gaming mouse that glides like magic over my ridiculously oversize [SteelSeries QcK Heavy][qck-heavy] gaming mouse pad. The thing is huge but it makes such a difference, it is never going to shift and you will never run out of space.

I'm a big fan of Sennheiser's headphones and use [HD 280 Pros][hd-280-pro] for when I want to shut out other noise and [HD 650's][hd-650] for when I want to listen to music on vinyl on my [Technic SL1200MK2][sl-1200] like a hipster... or when it is quiet. The 650's are so dreamy. I also keep some random mid-range Shure in-ear headphones in my bag for whenever I am traveling.

The other computer that kvm switch is hooked up to is a rapidly aging [Shuttle XPC][g2-7600] that I tend to use for any non-computationally intensive tasks, and generally being an always on and available device on the home network. That computer is usually attached to an array of no-longer-functioning external hard drives. I backup online now.

By my bed I keep one of the prototype Google Chrome [Cr-48][cr-48] Netbooks for light browsing and emailing on weekend mornings when I haven't quite convinced myself there is a reason to be up yet.

At the office I have the same setup as at home for my laptop, except no kvm and a [30" Dell monitor][3007wfp]. I also keep a [Wacom Bamboo Pen and Touch pad][bamboo] nearby for when I need to do some photo/graphic editing.

When away from my computer I usually have a recent Android phone, right now an [HTC Evo Shift 4G][evo-shift-4g], and my [Leica M8.2][m8.2] camera or one of my ancient Hasselblad 500C's. I always have my [Kindle wifi+3g][kindle] with me.

I also have an [Xbox 360][xbox-360], and both a U.S. and a European [PS3][] hooked up to a 1080p projector, for when one really needs to zone out with a long-winded RPG or run some cars into things.

### And what software?

I'm a Linux guy at heart, usually the latest version of [Ubuntu][], but I do use [OS X][macos] on my laptop, mostly because it is useful having another OS around to run some apps just don't have decent counterparts, though in the majority of cases I think most Linux apps I use outshine their OS X counterparts. In most cases I don't agree with Apple's opinions as to how I should use my hardware and software so I try to avoid them as much as possible.

Almost all of my time is spent either in a browser, [Google Chrome][chrome], a terminal (GNOME Terminal on Ubuntu or [iterm2][] on OS X), or in [gvim][vim] ([MacVim][] on OS X). I use [zsh][].

Chrome has a nice extension system so I use and write many extensions for it, the most notable being [Google Voice][google-voice.2] for phone stuff, Tab Menu for help finding tabs after long web binges, [AdBlock][] for its obvious purpose, and [VisivoTab][] for replacing my otherwise useless "new tab" page with a beautiful photograph.

In vim, besides using a reasonably modified vimrc, I also make heavy use of [NERD_comments plugin][nerdcommenter] and a slightly modified version of the tabComplete plugin.

Around development I use [git][] pretty much constantly, I even use it to manage projects that use bzr by using [git-bzr-ng][], so I also use a lot of [github][]. Lately I've also been using [Vagrant][] and [Chef][] quite often as they are really useful for setting up new virtual machines in which to test my software. I also spend a lot of time in IRC so I use [irssi][] in [screen][] on a remote server for that.

The apps that stand out on OS X and keep me from installing Ubuntu on my laptop are [Adobe Lightroom][lightroom] for photo management, [OmniGraffle][] for diagramming and [Keynote][] for presentations, though I have had some luck using alternate presentation formats lately. If you do have to use OS X, [Homebrew][] is the best software package manager out there, I even prefer it to most Linux alternatives.

The only other GUI apps I use regularly are [Skype][] for voice and chat and [Ario][] for controlling music via [mpd][], a music player daemon. I use Theremin on OS X but Ario is significantly more full-featured.

My phone is currently running last night's nightly build of [CyanogenMod 7][cyanogenmod], an alternative to the default Android firmware (or whatever your carrier has pushed on you), I mostly use the [Kindle][kindle-android], [Foursquare][foursquare-android], [GMail][gmail-android] and [Google Voice][google-voice-android] apps on it.

Oh, and I play a lot of [Starcraft 2][starcraft-2].

### What would be your dream setup?

I'd love to have some non-Apple hardware that was close to being as sleek and stylish as the current Macbooks, that had a great open source photo management app and a bunch of horsepower. I also want a beast of desktop box with too much storage and too much power and a huge graphics card that was dead silent and is hooked up to a 30" monitor and my current keyboard, mouse and mousepad. I also hope that one of the Android tablets coming out will be awesome enough that somebody will make an app for it that lets me annotate mockups and diagrams.
