### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Jesse Sheidlower](https://www.jessesword.com/ "Jesse's website."), and I am a lexicographer and language writer. My most recent project is the [Historical Dictionary of Science Fiction](https://sfdictionary.com/ "A science fiction dictionary."), a quotation-based reference to SF language. I spent fourteen years as an editor the [Oxford English Dictionary](http://oed.com/ "A dictionary."). I work as a software developer for my day job, and have various other side gigs, often focusing on alcohol, including co-running the [Threesome Tollbooth](http://threesometollbooth.com/ "A tiny cocktail bar in Brooklyn."), the world's smallest cocktail bar (currently on hiatus during the pandemic).

### What hardware do you use?

My desktop is homebuilt, using an InWin 901 Mini-ITX case, and including an ASRock AB350 motherboard, an [AMD Ryzen 5 2600 CPU][ryzen-5-2600], three different random SSDs, 32GB RAM, and an [EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 graphics card][geforce-gtx-1060] (that I mainly got for fooling around with ML stuff; I don't game). I have two [Dell U2718Q 27" 4K monitors][u2718q], which I love for the amount of screen real-estate they give me.

The desktop audio is running off several different Schiit devices, running a pair of [Genelec G One desktop speakers][g-one], with a [Genelec F One subwoofer][f-one] under my desk. (I also have some more dedicated and higher-end audio stuff which is beyond the scope of this.) Before the pandemic, I didn't bother with dedicated audio input, but now I've repurposed a [RØDE NT1-A condenser mic][nt1-a], plugged into a [Scarlett 2i2 audio interface][scarlett-2i2].

But far and away my favorite accessory is a custom keyboard from Datamancer, one of the last ones Richard Nagy built before he died. It's a stunning Art Deco design, with a fantastic feel, and a bunch of nice touches, like a Tux (the Linux penguin) "Windows" key, and a space bar with "space" in Morse code. I spend my entire working life on this keyboard, and it makes me incredibly happy, and everyone who comes to my place comments on it.

I have a few other machines. I have a FreeNAS box that I built from a SilverStone DS380B case, [ASRock C236 WSI motherboard][c236-wsi], an [Intel i3-6100 CPU][core-i3-6100], and a bunch of [WD Red drives][wd-red]. There's a generic mini-PC running [FreeBSD][] as a dedicated router for a [Tor][] bridge node, and a bunch of Raspberry Pi's scattered around, mainly to run music-related stuff. On the network side, I have a [Netgate SG-5100 pfSense firewall router][sg-5100-pfsense], and then several different switches and wireless devices from Ubiquiti.

### And what software?

I don't use anything too elaborate on the software side. My desktop is running [Debian Bullseye][debian]. I probably spend 95% of my time in [Emacs][], [Mutt][], [xfce4-terminal][], and the [Vivaldi browser][vivaldi], though I usually do also have [Firefox][] and [Opera][] browsers running. I use the older but still great [gmusicbrowser][] to play music on my desktop, though I also have an elaborate setup with [Mopidy][] and [Snapcast][] for the rest of the apartment.

### What would be your dream setup?

I actually think I'm pretty much there. I always do want to play around with things, and I'd love to have an excuse to build a new machine, upgrade what I have, and so forth. But as I don't game or do video editing, and don't do any real ML work, the reality is that my desktop is already ten times more powerful than I need.
