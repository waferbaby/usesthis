### Who are you, and what do you do?

[I'm](http://www.galaxykate.com/ "Kate's website.") an inventor, artist, and PhD student at UC Santa Cruz, go banana slugs! I worked in the games industry for 5 years, at Maxis, making algorithms to design the planets on [Spore][], and scripting the fire system on the latest [SimCity][]. I went back to grad school to get my PhD in Computer Science with the [Expressive Intelligence Studio](https://games.soe.ucsc.edu/ "The Center for Games and Playable Media at UC Santa Cruz."), a group of interdisciplinary artificial intelligence researchers using AI for expressive purposes, like digital characters and interactive art. At the same time, I founded [Seebright](https://seebright.com/ "Kate's AR company."), a startup for the phone-based VR/AR headset that I'd invented (as far as I know, I was the first to use phones for VR!) 

I'm most recently well-known for popularizing and educating people about procedural content generation in games and generative methods in many fields, with [blog posts](http://galaxykate0.tumblr.com/post/139774965871/so-you-want-to-build-a-generator "Kate's post on building a generator.") and [GDC](http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1023377/Tech "A GDC talk Kate took part in.") [talks](http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1024213/Practical-Procedural-Generation-for "Kate's GDC talk on procedural generation."), and developing the popular newbie-friendly text-generation language [Tracery][]. I also make a lot of [strange](https://vimeo.com/119618499 "Kate's flowers video on Vimeo.") [generative](http://tracery.io/kambamanx/ "Kate's song generator.") [works](http://tracery.io/kambamanx/ "Kate's other song generator.") of my own, including several [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LostTesla "Kate's Tesla Twitter bot.") [bots](https://twitter.com/tinyadv "Kate's space adventure Twitter bot.").

### What hardware do you use?

I use a [2015 MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] and the ultra-light [2016 Macbook][macbook.2] for travel. But many of my art installations use very unusual interfaces and a wide range of hardware toys, like Laser Pico projections on [styrofoam heads](https://vimeo.com/111024685 "Kate's talking head video on Vimeo."), a projection on a spandex screen with a [Kinect][] [interface](https://vimeo.com/217033311 "Kate's touch screen video on Vimeo."), a [Leap Motion][leap-motion-controller] controlling a [wall-sized projection](https://twitter.com/GalaxyKate/status/861071305201680385 "Kate's tweet about her projection."), and most recently, a [slime-filled balloon](https://twitter.com/GalaxyKate/status/860240206103945217 "Kate's tweet about her slime balloon.") and an [Arduino][].

### And what software?

I use [JavaScript][] almost exclusively now, after years of [Java][]. There are so many good libraries! I use [Sublime][sublime-text], [Transmit][], and after some dissatisfaction with [LightPaper][], I'm writing my own text editor for my dissertation work.

### What would be your dream setup?

I think I have my dream setup! Lots of oddball toys at home, plus my lightweight laptop for easy travel when backpacking between conferences. I would dearly love a big workshop with a laser-cutter and a CNC machine, though.
