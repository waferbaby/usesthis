#### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Hot Dad](http://hotdad.club/ "Erik's website.")/Erik Helwig. I make and release music and comedy and comedy music on the internet, the majority of it released initially through my modestly successful [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGY2w6hIZWwyxasBUN7wbaQ "Erik's YouTube channel"). My work is [Patreon-supported](https://www.patreon.com/hotdad "Erik's Patreon account."). I've often described what I do as _emotionally-charged comedy music_. I'm responsible for [that video with the Hedgehog image that a lot of people really, really, really like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eKv4BEujFU "Erik's YouTube song about an image of a hedgehog.").

I always enjoyed making funny things, but it wasn't until I tried to make it in _serious music_ (i.e. self-funded a [pro album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSqBB4G2WBw "Erik's full album, Light Sleeper, on YouTube.") by my initial moniker, Girls Who Care, and couldn't find any record label interest; I, in my inexperience/naivety, took this as a "major defeat" and didn't release that album for 3 more years) that I realized comedy music offered me more creative freedom (which is where that whole "emotionally-charged" bit comes in) and less overall competition. And YouTube exists, so that gives me a place to post videos and stuff. My terrific video editor/graphic designer is [Peter Bjorndal](https://bjornd.al "Peter's website.").

#### What hardware do you use?

I do almost everything "in the box" right now, for both creative and _limited financial resources_ reasons. In terms of hardware, I use a [UAD Apollo Quad][apollo] FireWire audio interface, a [Shure KSM32][ksm32] microphone for vocals, [KRK Rokit RP8 G1s][rokit-8] as my studio monitors, [Audio-Technica ATH-M50][ath-m50] headphones, a [Fender Telecaster][telecaster] + [Squire Stratocaster][stratocaster] + [Squire Mustang][mustang] bass, a [Yamaha PSS-470][portasound-pss-470] (not circuit bent), a [Novation Launchkey 49][launchkey-49] MIDI controller, and a [Novation Launchpad Mini][launchpad-mini]. I don't do anything all that crazy or interesting with anything - I tend to work in little flourishes of excitement + inspiration, so I'm just trying to capture ideas as quickly as possible and build, build, build from there. My current computer is one I built myself with an [i7-3770k][core-i7-3770k] at its core(s). I will be building a new machine soon. My video camera is a [Canon T5i][eos-rebel-t5i].

I have plenty of equipment for live shows too (I haven't been doing many of those; I hope to soon, though!), but I don't use any of it in my current recordings. I just bought a [Roland JC-77][jazz-chorus-jc-77]. I _will_ say that my live backing tracks are run from a 2011 [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro] with a [MOTU Ultralite MK1][ultralite] FireWire interface. It's an older interface that is "road-tested" and was recommended via internet forums for its reliability/stability.

#### And what software?

I record exclusively in [Ableton Live 10][live]. When I was first learning to compose music back in 2010ish, I realized that Live's session view was the most natural for me since my brain worked best when I just looped a section and built on that until I had something I was happy with. It allows me to work in manageable chunks instead of the vast expanse of a _full song_ (scary!). I normally record gibberish vocals for each section as well, and figure out the words later. I then take what I've built in session view, and record it into arrangement view, one section at a time until I've got a song. It just feels right! Sure, I still need to record vocals and make plenty o' tweaks after that, but this method allows me to _very rapidly_ create a pretty meaty skeleton, and, like the rest of us, once I have a skeleton, I feel much more confident.

As far as softsynths go, I primarily use the [TAL-U-NO-LX][]/[TAL-Noisemaker][] and [Sylenth1][]. I use a lot of UAD plugins. I tend to use a lot of the same plugins over and over again until I arbitrarily read an interview with someone far more talented than me who has some other plugin they really like, in which case, I give it a shot and potentially make it a new habit. I use a lot of the [1176][]/[LA-2A][] compressors, the [SSL E Channel Strip][ssl-4000-e-channel-strip], [Pultec EQs][pultec-passive-eq], [EMT 140][emt-140-classic-plate-reverberator] and [250][emt-250-classic-electronic-reverb] reverbs, the [Ampex ATR-102][atr-102-mastering-tape-recorder], [Neve 1073s][1073-preamp-and-eq], the [Fender '55 Tweed Deluxe][fender-55-tweed-deluxe] and [Chandler GAV19T][chandler-limited-gav19t-amplifier] for guitars, and the list goes on. I also use some Izotope, Soundtoys, and Waves plugins sometimes as well. [Superior Drummer 2][superior-drummer] is what I normally use for drums, along with some of the Ableton Live Suite kits/sounds. I learned everything I know about mixing/mastering from the brilliant [Andrew Maury](http://andrewmaury.net/ "Andrew's website.") (who produced/mixed/mastered my Girls Who Care record along with a handful of my other things), so often I end up using presets and tips he's taught me that have worked great in the past.

#### What would be your dream setup?

Doing what I do the way I do it, I wear a LOT of hats (some I like, others not so much), and that can get really exhausting. It's nice to have _all of the control_ (and it **definitely** helps to not have to split up my streaming royalties between multiple performers/songwriters), but the knowledge that others are highly specialized and adroit in their respective fields weighs on me and it's true, I could be releasing even better (imho) stuff if it was all being professionally mixed/mastered, in the same way that my videos became so much better after Peter began editing instead of me (visual art is definitely _not_ my strength). And that would subsequently free me up to work on writing something new instead of tweaking the mix all day (although I think I've definitely gotten better/more particular about what I like in that realm, and have grown to enjoy certain aspects of the process).

A dream setup for me would involve _the option_ of delegating tasks like mixing/mastering to outside professionals when it felt right/necessary. Higher budgets would make that possible. As far as upgrades, I don't have any specific ones, but I have plenty of nebulous ones. I'd love some analog synths to play with, new and vintage, cheap and fancy, along with the capability to easily record a drum kit (I own a DW drum kit, but I never use it on my recordings because it's not convenient to record at the moment). Another set of studio monitors for A/B'ing mixes, and more microphones generally. More software plugins, naturally. And all of these expansions would need to be within reasonable limits since I don't want to end up with analysis paralysis regarding which random device I want to use when trying to get started on a fleeting idea. I think it's most important to _just do it_, even if it's not totally perfect (you can't edit/improve something that doesn't exist!), and without this philosophy, let's just say I never would have have finished much of anything. Sure, I have plenty of details I get neurotic about in every track, but that doesn't change the fact that it's totally fine that a lot of the time I just grab a preset and start quickly building those melodies while they're fresh in my mind. Maybe tweak them later, maybe not. Who knows!
