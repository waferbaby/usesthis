### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [fritzvd](http://fritzvd.com/ "Fritz's website"), I make [music](http://cheesesofmexico.com/ "Fritz's band."), [software](https://github.com/fritzvd "Fritz's GitHub account."). I have worked at Nelen & Schuurmans for the last 4 years on [flood simulation](http://3di.nu/ "Flood simulation and water management.") and [maps](https://demo.lizard.net/ "Fritz's maps for the Lizard demo."). I'm about to make a bit of a switch and teach about making software at a [technical college](https://han.nl/ "A university in The Netherlands."), I already also teach informatics at a [high school](http://marnixcollege.nl/ "A high school in The Netherlands."). In my off time I make [games](https://github.com/fritzvd/mexicombat "The code for Fritz's fighting game on GitHub."), or [bread](https://twitter.com/fritzvd/status/771378368667381761 "Fritz's tweet about bread."). I also give [talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRSRVdLQ_-k "A YouTube video of Fritz's talk about NES development.") at times. Besides that I co-founded and run a [JavaScript meetup in Utrecht](http://www.meetup.com/Utrecht-JavaScript-Meetup/ "A JavaScript meetup in The Netherlands."). Lately I've been getting into old computers and started working on creating my own game for the [Famicom/NES][nes].

### What hardware do you use?

I used to use my [2010 Mac Mini][mac-mini] for most things, games, making music and editing videos. Even writing the occasional line of [Obj-C][objective-c] or some [Android][] stuff. But it's become quite old and slow. I stuck an SSD in it, and it ran way smoother. I gave it to my mom, though. At the moment I use a run-of-the-mill [Lenovo L430][thinkpad-l430] (Core i5, 2013 model) that belongs to my employer. With some extra RAM (16GB) for the flood modeling and an SSD, because it just makes sense.

For making music I have a [USB recording interface][ua-25] to which I hook up a classic: the [Shure SM58][sm58]. It's indestructable and sounds a lot better than its similarly priced counterparts. Often I steal my wife's [MacBook Air][macbook-air] to run [GarageBand][] or play with [GarageBand on my iPad][garageband-ios].

For developing on the NES I bought a [Kazzo][] and an empty NROM cartridge and a plastic case. But in hindsight I might have been better off with an [EverDrive][everdrive-n8]. The Kazzo only runs on Windows (at least I'm not feeling the vibe to recreate a libusb to support it on Linux).

Most of the time I play my [Fender Sonaran][sonoran-sce], but I'm saving up for something similar to a [Larrivee OM-03][om-03].

I have a [Sony Xperia Z2][xperia-z2] which I have used intensively over the last 2 years, and it's still working fine. So I'll stick with that for another year (or 2).

I ride a Jan Janssen Vuelta from the mid 90s.

### And what software?

I've been running [Ubuntu][] since about 2005 and I haven't really felt the need to switch. If I do it might be an [Arch-like][arch-linux], or to [Mac OS X][macos], just because [Logic][logic-pro] / Garageband and [iOS][] development can only run on OS X.

You will see me browsing the internet alternating [Chrome][] and [Firefox][] (in alphabetical order). These 2 browsers are ALWAYS running.

For editing I use [vim][] and [Atom][] when I feel like using a mouse or for its [Markdown][] previews. I use [GIMP][] for image manipulation.

For developing for the NES I run [Gulp][] to watch the files and start the compilation if something changed. It then opens both [Nestopia][] and [FCEUX][] to checkout the build.

I use [JavaScript][], [node.js][], [Python][] and [Haxe][] and sometimes do a little of [C][], [C#][c-sharp], [Rust][], and 6502 assembly. When I make games I default to [HaxePunk][] or use [Blender][] and sometimes [Unity][].

[Spotify][] is always running. And I'm always looking for sourdough recipes on websites like [The Perfect Loaf](http://theperfectloaf.com/ "A bread website.") or [Breadtopia](http://breadtopia.com/ "A bread website.")

When I make music I just use my guitar and a pen and paper. Or as mentioned I fiddle with GarageBand on my iPad or on my wife's MacBook Air.

When I cycle I sometimes use [Strava][] to log my speed and distance.

### What would be your dream setup?

Imagine a little cottage in lush valley next to a body of water or the ocean. In the shed next to the cottage there are a bunch of retro consoles / computers ([SNES][], [SMD/SG][genesis], [C64][commodore-64], [MSX][]) and cartridges (originals, and programmable). Turn the corner you see my desk, a [Fender Rhodes][rhodes], and a collection of vintage [Fender Stratocasters][stratocaster] with a [Fender Vibro-King][vibro-king]. Next to that you find my Martin and Guild acoustic guitars. A [Neumann D-01][d-01] on a stand for recording.

In this scenario I have a [Mac Pro][mac-pro] on which I also do Blender renders and a lightweight laptop I can do all the things I need. Possibly a Macbook but I hope by then Linux will also be able to run Logic Pro.

Outside there's a rack of bicycles that look like they could enter [L'Eroica](http://eroica.cc/ "A bicycle race in Italy."). Next to that a big surfboard and a big stone oven. A fire's burning, and on it there's a Potjie brewing. The chicken are in the coop frolicking and clucking. My son is playing in the grass. My wife and I sit by the fire and watch the sunset with a glass of delicious Malbec.
