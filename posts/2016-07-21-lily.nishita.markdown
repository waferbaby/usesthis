### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Lily Nishita](http://lilynishita.com "Lily's website."), a graphic designer/illustrator living and working in Los Angeles. I work at [Naughty Dog](http://www.naughtydog.com/ "A video game company.") during the day, doing everything from product design to in-game assets. My after hours are spent on a mix of [freelance](http://lilynishita.com/#/idle-weekend/ "An example of Lily's freelance art.") and [personal illustration](http://lilynishita.com/#/personal-illustration/ "Examples of Lily's illustrations."). I'm also getting really into drawing tiny comics, and I'm hoping to do a longer one soon!

### What hardware do you use?

For my home setup I'm on a 2012 [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro], and I use a [Cintiq 22HD tablet][cintiq] to do a lot of my drawing on, and use it instead of a mouse for convenience. I also have a [Razer Nostromo][nostromo] gaming keypad with a few different sets of keyboard shortcuts mapped to it for whatever I happen to be working on. It doesn't replace the main keyboard, but the keypad speeds up my workflow immensely and saves me from bouncing all over a keyboard. I also have a [Logitech G502 gaming mouse][g502] for 3D that I love the feel of, since it's pretty hefty but still fits my hand. It's unfortunate I like it so much, since the software doesn't work on Macs so I can't turn off the flashing rainbow lights!

I also keep a few sketchbooks stashed around and an assortment of pens for quick ideas. My favorites right now are the Kuretake Fude brush pen no. 55, [Pilot Pocket brush pens][pocket-brush-pen], [Pilot Hi-Tec-C][hi-tec-c] .3 pen and [Mildliners][mildliner]. The brush pens have a more rubbery tip, so I can get a lot of nice line variation with clean edges. For sketchbooks I usually have 2 or 3 going at once. Right now I keep a Moleskine blank notebook in my bag for notes and doodling when I'm out and about and a Cottonwood Arts sketchbook by my desk.

I also have a pair of slippers to wear while I work at home (and an extra pair for the office) because I get distracted if my feet are touching the cold floor. Having my dog close by is great too - he's a perfect reminder to take little breaks :)

### And what software?

I primarily use [Photoshop][], [Illustrator][] and occasionally [InDesign][] in that order for everything. For illustration I use a lot of Photoshop brushes collected from friends and blogs, as well as Kyle Webster's stellar brush packs. For design work I usually start sketching in Photoshop then move on to Illustratorm since I don't keep a scanner around.

When starting a new project I make [Pinterest][] boards for inspiration and brainstorming. To stay organized I use a mix of [Google Docs][google-docs], the [Fantastical 2 calendar app][fantastical], and [Dropbox][]. I also usually have [iTunes][] or [Spotify][] open to have some background noise while I work. [TweetDeck][] ([follow me](https://twitter.com/lazerlily "Lily's Twitter account.")), [Slack][], and [Messages][] are usually open too.

I've also been experimenting with [MODO][] for 3D to incorporate into my work, but I've only scratched the surface, so hopefully I'll be able to do more in the future.

### What would be your dream setup?

I'm really looking forward to getting a faster home computer - this one has served me well but is nearly 4 years old!
