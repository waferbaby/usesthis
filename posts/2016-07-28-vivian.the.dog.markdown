### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm Vivian, [a 6-foot tall dachshund living in New York City](http://mitchboyer.com/vivian-the-dog "Vivian's webpage."). I basically eat food and sleep 24/7. I'm also working on a children's book titled, ["Vivian the Dog Moves to Brooklyn."](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mitchboyer/vivian-the-dog-moves-to-brooklyn/ "Vivian's Kickstarter project.") The book is all about my move from Albuquerque, New Mexico to Brooklyn, New York. New York City is not really a great place for a giant dog to be.

### What hardware do you use?

**Mitch**: I'm gonna take over here - hi, I'm [Mitch](http://mitchboyer.com/ "Mitch's website."), Vivian's owner, and I work as an illustrator and photographer. As I'm sure you've assumed, [Vivian is not actually 6 feet tall](https://www.instagram.com/p/BF0-PPSLNxK/ "A photo of Vivian on Instagram."). She's just barely over a foot tall and weighs 13 lbs. [All of the pictures in the book are photo-illustrations](http://imgur.com/gallery/cImIW "Details of how Mitch takes photos of Vivian.").

I've been shooting the images on the [Fujifilm X‑T10][x-t10] with a [35mm lens][xf35mmf2-r-wr]. I originally purchased the Fuji as a casual travel camera, but I loved the images it was taking so much that I now use it more than the [Canon 5D][eos-5d]. A lot of the scenes we shoot are in busy city areas, so it helps to have a low profile camera. Most people just assume I'm another tourist taking a picture of the New York Skyline.

I edit on my 27" [iMac][]. I haven't pushed for the Retina version yet, maybe next time. It does the job just fine. Oh, I forgot! before I shoot the images, I make a storyboard in my Moleskin notebook. I prefer the squared pattern version. When I'm sketching I like to work in pencil first and then ink using a [Staedtler Pigment Liner pen][pigment-liner-308]. I usually work with a 0.3mm tip. Okay, back to the Mac! I love this thing. The 27" screen is a great size and gives me space to work in several programs at once. My computer desktop is usually a mess with several windows open at once. I used to be very OCD about only having one program open at once, but I've let that go.

While editing the photos I use the [Wacom Bamboo tablet][bamboo]. It's a little old and not the [Intuos][] series or anything, but it works just fine. I worked for a few years on the super big Intuos while I was a VFX artist, and they really all feel the same to me. I like to work on the pixel level, so I'm always zoomed in, and a more sensitive tablet doesn't matter at that point.

**Vivian**: I use a standard leash and poop bags most days. Nothing fancy.

### And what software?

**Mitch**: I process the raw files from the Fuji in [Adobe Lightroom][lightroom] and use the [VSCO Film][vsco-film] 02 pack a lot. I'm not a fan of the strong roll off you get in the highlights with digital images, and I think VSCO does a good job of smoothing that out. I love their Kodak Portra 400 emulator.

Once I've processed the files, I pull them into [Photoshop][] and finish them there. No special filters or plugins. Just vanilla Photoshop.

Outside of image processing, I use [Sunrise][] for my calander - so sad they're being eaten by [Outlook][]. I'm writing this in [Grammarly][] because I'm constantly afraid of making stupid grammatical mistakes. I've been on a [Duolingo][duolingo-ios] kick lately, my girlfriend is Colombian and I've been learning Spanish, it's going pretty well. Oh, and I'm a huge [Spotify][] junkie. I'm always listening to something.

**Vivian**: What's software? Can I eat it?

### What would be your dream setup?

**Vivian**: Probably having 3-5 manservants shoveling food into my mouth at all times, while lounging in my [penthouse overlooking Central Park](http://www.forbes.com/sites/morganbrennan/2012/07/30/a-look-at-new-york-citys-100-million-penthouse/ "An article about a $100 million penthouse in New York.").

**Mitch**: Honestly, I'm pretty happy with what I have now. I guess I'd always love to grab an [iPad Pro][ipad-pro] - I've been wanting to play around with the [Pencil][apple-pencil] for a while now. I've been getting back into filmmaking, so I've got my eye on a [Blackmagic Cinema Camera][cinema-camera] and some nice Zeiss Primes. But that's a pipe dream for now, and it's usually better to rent that stuff. We'll see!
