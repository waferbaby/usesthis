### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is Fabi Reyna: I'm Mexican, I'm a guitarist, I'm usually late and I'm the founder and Editor In Chief of [She Shreds Magazine](http://www.sheshredsmag.com/ "A magazine dedicated to female guitarists."). 

### What hardware do you use?

Currently, at this very moment, I use...

An [STV Ernie Ball electric guitar][st-vincent] (for bass, rhythm and lead)

plugged into a [BOSS RC-300 Loop station][rc-300] (the really big one)

into a Malekko Heavy Industries Reverb (the little baby pocket sized one) which I highly recommend

into an [Earthquaker Devices Organizer][organizer] (makes your guitar sound like an organ) 

into a BOSS tuner (keeps your guitar sounding fresh) 

into a [Fender Hot Rod Deluxe amp][hot-rod-deluxe] (currently looking for something that can handle more power). 

### And what software?

The software of my brain and slowly but surely [Ableton Live][live].

### What would be your dream setup?

I'm not sure or really care about the technical name for all of this but I'd love to have a situation where I can sync up my loop pedal to Ableton Live so I can play and control my own beats better. I also want a setup where I can easily switch from bass tones to lead tin like tones and feel completely entrenched in my guitar - so maybe like 2-3 completely opposing amps to balance out the EQ.

I'd really just like to figure out a setup where I can easily control the instruments I'm playing on my own. I dream of playing live with 10+ instruments on stage and a wall of half stacks.
