The Setup is a website of nerdy interviews, asking people what they use to get the job done. It's a static site generated by [Dimples](http://github.com/waferbaby/dimples/ "A very simple static site generator."), my dumb little site generator.

Interested in cloning the site for your own interviews, similar or otherwise? HELL YEAH! These are the questions I email people:

	1) Who are you, and what do you do?
	2) What hardware do you use?
	3) And what software?
	4) What would be your dream setup?

If you *do* make your own version, please send me a note - I'd love to add it to the Community page!

butts.
