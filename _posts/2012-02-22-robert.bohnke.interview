### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is Robert Böhnke, though I usually go by [Robb](http://robb.is/ "Robert's website."). Character encoding is tricky, which is why some people prefer calling me Mr. BÃ¶hnke.

I work at [SoundCloud][], mostly on the [Mac][soundcloud-mac] and [iOS][soundcloud-ios] applications, sometimes at [Music Hack Days](http://musichackday.org/ "An audio hack day."). Besides that, I study Computer Science in my native Berlin.

### What hardware are you using?

I recently treated myself to a maxed-out 13" [MacBook Air][macbook-air] with English International keyboard layout and a matching Thunderbolt Display. A great machine and quite powerful to boot, even giving me decent framerates in 3D games.

I own a monome [sixty four][sixty-four] and a [one twenty eight][one-twenty-eight], as well as an [arc 4][arc], beautifully minimalistic controllers, that have gathered an unfortunate amount of dust over the last couple of months.

I have a pair of [Ultrasone DJ1 Pro headphones][dj-1-pro] that I carry around with me all the time.

At work, my machine is a early 2011, top-of-the-line 27" [iMac][], probably the fastest computer I've ever worked on and makes for a great development machine.

I run a dual monitor set up, the other display being some 24" Samsung screen. Nothing to write home about but the extra pixels are very much appreciated.

My phone is a [iPhone 4S][iphone-4s], I also own an [iPad 2][ipad-2].

### And what software?

I'm not emotionally attached to any particular brand or operating system. Still, I run [OS X Lion][mac-os-x] almost exclusively, the only exception being the occasional game on [Windows 7][windows-7].

I use a very clever tool called [F.lux][] to automatically adjust my monitor's white-point based on the time of day. It takes a great amount of stress off your eyes and *I urge everyone to try it out* for a couple of days. It's cross platform, too.

I've ditched OS X's own Terminal.app for [iTerm 2][iterm2], which sports proper fullscreen, split windows, auto-completion and much more.
However, its killer feature is the Hotkey window, which allows me to open a fast, fullscreen console no matter what I am currently doing. Using the awkwardly named [PCKeyboardHack][], I mapped my Caps Lock key to F13, which I then made the trigger for the Hotkey window – finally putting that key to a good use.

Inside of iTerm 2, I run [zsh][] using the default theme + some plugins from [oh my zsh][oh-my-zsh].

Most of my iOS and Mac development happens inside of [Xcode 4][xcode]. It crashes probably a few times a day but on a fast machine, I can live with that.

My text editor of choice is currently [Sublime Text 2][sublime-text-2]. I like it because it is fast, cross-platform, good looking and has a nice distraction free mode in which I am currently writing this interview. Someday, I'll sit down and learn all its fancy features.

If I write something, I will probably check it into [git][] at some point and push it to [Github][].

My go-to language is [CoffeeScript][], my preferred browser is [Chrome][] and I use [Sparrow][] for E-Mail.

On the go and off the grid, I read articles in [Instapaper][instapaper-ios] and books using the [Readmill][readmill-ios] app and listen to [Spotify][spotify-ios].

### What would be your dream setup?

I'm very happy with what I currently have. My dream set up would probably be two large displays, powered by a thin and light laptop without fans that still has good graphics performance. I'm almost there.
