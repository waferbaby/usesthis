### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm an artist, mainly [someone who likes to draw](http://www.amyjeanporter.com/ "Amy's website."). I've drawn a lot of animals. Most recently [lambs](http://www.amyjeanporter.com/images/lamb/ "Amy's drawings for the book, Of Lamb.") for a book project with Matthea Harvey and [McSweeney's](http://store.mcsweeneys.net/index.cfm/fuseaction/catalog.detail/object_id/6c24f9c5-c414-4a6c-b07a-1ea76f1c5e32/OfLamb.cfm "The poetry book Amy painted for."). I live in the woods outside of New Haven, Connecticut, with my family and an ever-active crew of hungry [squirrels](http://amyjeanporter.com/images/mammals/pages/x_squirrel1.htm "Amy's squirrel.") and skunks.

### What hardware are you using?

I have a sturdy hand-me-down table/desk from Ikea. It's like a butcher block. There's a line up of colored pencils and stacks of books and cards and photos. On another sturdy desk - an old wooden teacher's desk that my husband and I picked up for 20 bucks at a lawn sale - we have a 13" [MacBook Pro][macbook-pro], a couple of external hard drives, an old Canon scanner, a printer, and an old Canon point-and-shoot camera. 

I make my drawings by hand, mainly at the butcher-block table, though for the summer I've had a lovely empty summer studio. I use mainly pencil, ink, and gouache. I'm addicted to gouache because of the colors you can get and because it has such a soft surface, like powdered sugar. I don't do much work digitally, I prefer making things by hand, so I've just needed a way to capture images and get them online (for my site and places like [The Awl](http://www.theawl.com/tag/amy-jean-porter "Amy's drawings on The Awl.") and [20x200](http://www.20x200.com/artists/amy-jean-porter.html "Amy's profile on 20x200.")). 

### And what software?

Your basic Adobe CS - [Photoshop][], [GoLive][]. Sometimes I try [InDesign][] and [Illustrator][], but just for simple things. I like this idea of keeping everything ridiculously simple - my site is pretty much straight html (originally created by my pals at [Gluekit](http://www.gluekit.com/ "Kathleen and Christopher make illustrations.") - thanks forever!). I've had this thing my whole life about trying to make the most out of two crayons and a piece of paper.

The MacBook is also essential for listening to podcasts while I work. I discovered a while ago that I must listen to people talking (not singing, not music) while I work. It keeps part of my brain entertained so that the other part can focus on tiny tedious things. I think of it this way because I listen a lot to [Radiolab](http://www.radiolab.org/ "A radio show.") and they're constantly talking about brains. Before podcasts were popular, I had a wind-up low-frequency emergency radio and I would listen to CBS 880. The act of winding the thing up every 20 minutes or so was satisfying.

### What would be your dream setup?

The big dream would be to build a studio behind our house with two stories and north facing skylights and lots of bookshelves, and a sink. There was an article in the Times about kid houses and it's a weird article, but the tiny houses did have [running water](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/21/garden/playhouses-childs-play-grown-up-cash.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all "The NYT article on playhouses."). I was impressed. I'd love a new [iMac][] and a big, properly calibrated scanner so I can get better color out of the scans I make. One of those old, awesome flat files would be great, too. A rug with some kind of [Anni Albers](http://www.albersfoundation.org/Albers.php?inc=Galleries&g=a007 "An Anni Albers artwork.") pattern. A dog. Maybe some chickens or [goats](http://www.amazon.com/Goat-Handbook-Barrons-Pet-Handbooks/dp/0764132687/ "A book on goats.") in the yard. The kids could name them. I would draw them.
